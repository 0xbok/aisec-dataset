## [M] Invalid handling of flash loan fees in `PositionAction::onCreditFlashLoan`, forcing it to always revert

When users take a flash loan, an amount is sent to the receiver, and then some action takes place, after that action that sent amount is expected to be paid and some fee. Users can also call `PositionAction::decreaseLever` through a proxy, to "Decrease the leverage of a position by taking out a credit flash loan to withdraw and sell collateral", after it is called, the flash loan lender sends the credit and calls `onCreditFlashLoan`, which handles all that logic.

This was reported in [Issue 524](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-loopfi-findings/issues/524), and a fix has been implemented. However, the fix is incomplete, and the `onCreditFlashLoan` will always revert when the fees are `>0`.

The fix added includes adding fees to the approval amounts:

```solidity
underlyingToken.forceApprove(address(leverParams.vault), subDebt + fee);
underlyingToken.forceApprove(address(flashlender), subDebt + fee);
```

That fix still misses a point; the amount coming from the flash lender is constant, and that amount will be used to repay a position's debt. The issue here is that all the amount is being used to repay without accounting for the extra fees that the flash lender will be requesting.

This causes `PositionAction::onCreditFlashLoan` to always revert.

### Proof of Concept

Add the following test in `src/test/integration/PositionAction20.lever.t.sol`:

```solidity
function test_leverageDownNotAccountingFees() public {
    // Re-initialize the system to have fees > 0
    flashlender = new Flashlender(IPoolV3(address(liquidityPool)), 0.01 ether);
    liquidityPool.setCreditManagerDebtLimit(address(flashlender), type(uint256).max);
    positionAction = new PositionAction20(
        address(flashlender),
        address(swapAction),
        address(poolAction),
        address(vaultRegistry)
    );

    uint256 depositAmount = 1_000 ether;
    uint256 borrowAmount = 200 ether;

    deal(address(token), user, depositAmount);

    address[] memory assets = new address[](2);
    assets[0] = address(underlyingToken);
    assets[1] = address(token);

    vm.startPrank(user);

    // User deposits 1k ETH collateral
    token.approve(address(vault), type(uint256).max);
    vault.deposit(address(userProxy), depositAmount);

    // User borrows 200 ETH
    userProxy.execute(
        address(positionAction),
        abi.encodeWithSelector(
            positionAction.borrow.selector,
            address(userProxy),
            address(vault),
            CreditParams({amount: borrowAmount, creditor: user, auxSwap: emptySwap})
        )
    );

    vm.expectRevert(bytes("ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance"));
    userProxy.execute(
        address(positionAction),
        abi.encodeWithSelector(
            positionAction.decreaseLever.selector,
            LeverParams({
                position: address(userProxy),
                vault: address(vault),
                collateralToken: address(token),
                primarySwap: SwapParams({
                    swapProtocol: SwapProtocol.BALANCER,
                    swapType: SwapType.EXACT_OUT,
                    assetIn: address(token),
                    amount: 1 ether,
                    limit: 2 ether,
                    recipient: address(positionAction),
                    residualRecipient: address(positionAction),
                    deadline: block.timestamp,
                    args: abi.encode(weightedPoolIdArray, assets)
                }),
                auxSwap: emptySwap,
                auxAction: emptyPoolActionParams
            }),
            2 ether,
            address(userProxy)
        )
    );

    vm.stopPrank();
}
```
