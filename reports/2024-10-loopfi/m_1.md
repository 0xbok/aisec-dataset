## [M] Invalid handling of flash loan fees in `PositionAction::onCreditFlashLoan`, forcing it to always revert

When users take a flash loan, an amount is sent to the receiver, and then some action takes place, after that action that sent amount is expected to be paid and some fee. Users can also call `PositionAction::decreaseLever` through a proxy, to "Decrease the leverage of a position by taking out a credit flash loan to withdraw and sell collateral", after it is called, the flash loan lender sends the credit and calls `onCreditFlashLoan`, which handles all that logic.

`onCreditFlashLoan` will always revert when the fees are `>0`, as it includes adding fees to the approval amounts:

[PositionAction.sol#L466](src/proxy/PositionAction.sol#L466):
```solidity
underlyingToken.forceApprove(address(leverParams.vault), subDebt + fee);
```

[PositionAction.sol#L527](src/proxy/PositionAction.sol#L527):
```solidity
underlyingToken.forceApprove(address(flashlender), subDebt + fee);
```

The amount coming from the flash lender is constant, and that amount will be used to repay a position's debt. The issue here is that all the amount is being used to repay without accounting for the extra fees that the flash lender will be requesting.

This causes `PositionAction::onCreditFlashLoan` to always revert.
