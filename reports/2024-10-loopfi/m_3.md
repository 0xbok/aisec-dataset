## [M] `PositionAction4626.sol#_onWithdraw` should withdraw from position CDPVault position instead of `address(this)`

`PositionAction4626.sol#_onWithdraw` does not withdraw from the correct position, it should withdraw from `position` instead of `address(this)`.

[PositionAction4626.sol#L61-L76](src/proxy/PositionAction4626.sol#L61-L76):
```solidity
    function _onWithdraw(
        address vault,
        address /*position*/,
        address dst,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal override returns (uint256) {
@>      uint256 collateralWithdrawn = ICDPVault(vault).withdraw(address(this), amount);

        // if collateral is not the dst token, we need to withdraw the underlying from the ERC4626 vault
        address collateral = address(ICDPVault(vault).token());
        if (dst != collateral) {
            collateralWithdrawn = IERC4626(collateral).redeem(collateralWithdrawn, address(this), address(this));
        }

        return collateralWithdrawn;
    }
