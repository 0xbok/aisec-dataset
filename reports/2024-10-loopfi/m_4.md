## [M] `PositionActionPendle.sol#_onWithdraw` does not have slippage parameter `minOut` set

When performing withdraws on `PositionActionPendle` and exiting Pendle pools, users may lose funds due to not setting slippage.

### Bug Description

*Note: This is a new issue that was introduced by the latest code diff.*

The dataflow for withdrawing on `PositionActionPendle` is:
1. User withdraws collateral (which is a Pendle token) from CDPVault.
2. User performs pendle pool exit.

The issue is in step 2; since `minOut` is set to 0, users may receive less output tokens than expected.

```solidity
    function _onWithdraw(
        address vault,
        address position,
        address dst,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal override returns (uint256) {
        uint256 collateralWithdrawn = ICDPVault(vault).withdraw(address(position), amount);
        address collateralToken = address(ICDPVault(vault).token());

        if (dst != collateralToken && dst != address(0)) {
            PoolActionParams memory poolActionParams = PoolActionParams({
                protocol: Protocol.PENDLE,
@>              minOut: 0, // @audit-bug: No slippage.
                recipient: address(this),
                args: abi.encode(
                    collateralToken,
                    collateralWithdrawn,
                    dst
                )
            });

            bytes memory exitData = _delegateCall(
                address(poolAction),
                abi.encodeWithSelector(poolAction.exit.selector, poolActionParams)
            );

            collateralWithdrawn = abi.decode(exitData, (uint256));
        }
        return collateralWithdrawn;
    }
```
