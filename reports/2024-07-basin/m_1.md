## [M] For extreme ratios, `getRatiosFromPriceSwap` will return data for which is impossible to converge into a reserve

The Basin team has implemented look up table to fetch pre-calculated values, which are close to the `targetPrice` to decrease the complexity of `calcReserveAtRatioSwap` and `calcReserveAtRatioLiquidity` functions.

[Stable2LUT1](relative_path_091409:src/functions/StableLUT/Stable2LUT1.sol#L740) has a function `getRatiosFromPriceSwap`, which returns `PriceData` struct based on provided `price`.

We can see that in case of super extreme price, the function will revert with `LUT: Invalid price`, but there is also support for extreme prices, which we assume should work correctly, when such situation occurs.

We will investigate an edge case, which is present when we enter `if (price < 0.213318e6)` and price is above `0.001083e6`. In such situations, the function will return the following struct:

```
    PriceData(
    0.213318e6, // highPrice
    0.188693329162796575e18,
    2.410556040105746423e18,
    0.001083e6, // lowPrice                       
    0.005263157894736842e18,                      
    10.522774272309483479e18,
    1e18
    );
```

If you notice, we have a large gap between `highPrice` and `lowPrice` and more precisely. The following results in large jump in reserves calculation when `updateReserve` which leads to skipping the target price sequentially, which moves away `pd.currentPrice` until we exit the `for` loop, which returns 0.

Here is an estimation of the impact based on the PoC which is below:

**For a ratio `~ 1:4.6` of the price of the tokens:**

- We have a `targetPrice` of 212104 (0.21).
- We end up with reserves for a price `44957 (0.04)`, which is `~ X5` less than the requested amount.
- As result we receive `3623929482258792273`, instead of `2421185918213441156`, which is a big difference.
- Note that we don't return the compromised data, but this is the calculated value on the last iteration.

### Proof of Concept

Place the following test inside `/test/beanstalk/BeanstalkStable2.calcReserveAtRatioLiquidity.t.sol` and run it with `forge test --mt "test_calcReserveAtRatioSwapSkipTarget" -vv`:

```
        function test_calcReserveAtRatioSwapSkipTarget() public view {
            uint256[] memory reserves = new uint256[](2);
            reserves[0] = 1e18;
            reserves[1] = 1e18;
            uint256[] memory ratios = new uint256[](2);
            ratios[0] = 4202;
            ratios[1] = 19811;

            // 4202 * 1e6 / 19811  = 212104 = 0.212 / 1  = 1 : 4.6
            //                                0.04  / 1  = 1 : 25    

            uint256 reserve1 = _f.calcReserveAtRatioSwap(reserves, 1, ratios, data);
            //console.log("Reserves 1 :", reserve1);
        }
```

You can further add `console.log` inside the for loop of `calcReserveAtRatioSwap` and log `pd.currentPrice` on each update. Notice that each time, the current price is further away from the target. Here are logs:
