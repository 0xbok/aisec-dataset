## [H] User could withdraw more than supposed to, forcing last user withdraw to fail

Within Wildcat, withdraw requests are put into batches. Users first queue their withdraws and whenever there's sufficient liquidity, they're filled at the current rate. Usually, withdraw requests are only executable after the expiry passes and then all users within the batch get a cut from the `batch.normalizedAmountPaid` proportional to the scaled amount they've requested a withdraw for.

[WildcatMarketWithdrawals.sol#L247-L249](src/market/WildcatMarketWithdrawals.sol#L247-L249):
```solidity
    uint128 newTotalWithdrawn = uint128(
      MathUtils.mulDiv(batch.normalizedAmountPaid, status.scaledAmount, batch.scaledTotalAmount)
    );
```

This makes sure that the sum of all withdraws doesn't exceed the total `batch.normalizedAmountPaid`.

However, this invariant could be broken, if the market is closed as it allows for a batch's withdraws to be executed, before all requests are added.

Consider the market is made of 3 lenders - Alice, Bob and Laurence.

1.  Alice queues a larger withdraw with an expiry time 1 year in the future.
2.  Market gets closed.
3.  Alice executes her withdraw request at the current rate.
4.  Bob makes queues multiple smaller requests. As they're smaller, the normalized amount they represent suffers higher precision loss. Because they're part of the whole batch, they also slightly lower the batch's overall rate.
5.  Bob executes his requests.
6.  Laurence queues a withdraw for his entire amount. When he attempts to execute it, it will fail. This is because Alice has executed her withdraw at a higher rate than the current one and there's now insufficient `state.normalizedUnclaimedWithdrawals`

Note: marking this as High severity as it both could happen intentionally (attacker purposefully queuing numerous low-value withdraws to cause rounding down) and also with normal behaviour in high-value closed access markets where a user's withdraw could easily be in the hundreds of thousands.

Also breaks core invariant:

> The sum of all transfer amounts for withdrawal executions in a batch must be less than or equal to batch.normalizedAmountPaid
