### Impact

The [Documentation](https://docs.wildcat.finance/technical-overview/security-developer-dives/hooks/access-control-hooks#role-providers) suggests that a role provider can be a "push" provider (one that "pushes" credentials into the hooks contract by calling `grantRole`) and a "pull" provider (one that the hook calls via `getCredential` or `validateCredential`).

The documentation also states that:

> Role providers do not have to implement any of these functions - a role provider can be an EOA.

But in fact, only the initial deployer can be an EOA provider, since it is coded in the constructor. Any other EOA provider that the borrower tries to add via `addRoleProvider` will fail because it does not implement the interface.
