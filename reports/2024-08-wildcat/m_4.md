## [M] `FixedTermLoanHook` looks at `block.timestamp` instead of `expiry`

The idea of `FixedTermLoanHook` is to only allow for withdrawals after a certain term end time. However, the problem is that the current implementation does not look at the expiry, but instead at the `block.timestamp`.

```solidity
  function onQueueWithdrawal(
    address lender,
    uint32 /* expiry */,
    uint /* scaledAmount */,
    MarketState calldata /* state */,
    bytes calldata hooksData
  ) external override {
    HookedMarket memory market = _hookedMarkets[msg.sender];
    if (!market.isHooked) revert NotHookedMarket();
    if (market.fixedTermEndTime > block.timestamp) {
      revert WithdrawBeforeTermEnd();
    }
```

This creates inconsistencies such as forcing users not only to wait until term's end, but also having to wait an extra `withdrawalBatchDuration` before they're able to withdraw their funds.
