## [M] No lender is able to exit even after the market is closed

When a borrower creates a market hooked by a [fixed-term hook](relative_path_091409:src/access/FixedTermLoanHooks.sol), all lenders are prohibited from withdrawing their assets from the market before the fixed-term time has elapsed.

The borrower can close the market at any time. However, `fixedTermEndTime` of the market is not updated, preventing lenders from withdrawing their assets if `fixedTermEndTime` has not yet elapsed.

Copy below codes to [WildcatMarket.t.sol](relative_path_091409:test/market/WildcatMarket.t.sol) and run forge test --match-test test_closeMarket_BeforeFixedTermExpired:

```solidity
  function test_closeMarket_BeforeFixedTermExpired() external {
    //@audit-info deploy a FixedTermLoanHooks template
    address fixedTermHookTemplate = LibStoredInitCode.deployInitCode(type(FixedTermLoanHooks).creationCode);
    hooksFactory.addHooksTemplate(
      fixedTermHookTemplate,
      'FixedTermLoanHooks',
      address(0),
      address(0),
      0,
      0
    );
    
    vm.startPrank(borrower);
    //@audit-info borrower deploy a FixedTermLoanHooks hookInstance
    address hooksInstance = hooksFactory.deployHooksInstance(fixedTermHookTemplate, '');
    DeployMarketInputs memory parameters = DeployMarketInputs({
      asset: address(asset),
      namePrefix: 'name',
      symbolPrefix: 'symbol',
      maxTotalSupply: type(uint128).max,

      withdrawalBatchDuration: 10000,
      reserveRatioBips: 10000,
      delinquencyGracePeriod: 10000,
      hooks: EmptyHooksConfig.setHooksAddress(address(hooksInstance))
    });
    //@audit-info borrower deploy a market hooked by a FixedTermLoanHooks hookInstance
    address market = hooksFactory.deployMarket(

    );
    vm.stopPrank();
    //@audit-info lenders can only withdraw their asset one year later
    assertEq(FixedTermLoanHooks(hooksInstance).getHookedMarket(market).fixedTermEndTime, block.timestamp + (365 days));
    //@audit-info alice deposit 50K asset into market
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    asset.approve(market, type(uint).max);
    WildcatMarket(market).depositUpTo(50_000e18);

    assertTrue(WildcatMarket(market).isClosed());
    //@audit-info however, alice can not withdraw her asset due to the unexpired fixed term.

    vm.prank(alice);
    WildcatMarket(market).queueFullWithdrawal();
