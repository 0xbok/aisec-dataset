## [M] No lender is able to exit even after the market is closed

When a borrower creates a market hooked by a [fixed-term hook](repos/2024-08-wildcat/src/access/FixedTermLoanHooks.sol), all lenders are prohibited from withdrawing their assets from the market before the fixed-term time has elapsed.

The borrower can close the market at any time. However, `fixedTermEndTime` of the market is not updated, preventing lenders from withdrawing their assets if `fixedTermEndTime` has not yet elapsed.
