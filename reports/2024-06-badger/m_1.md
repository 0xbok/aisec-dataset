## [M] Incorrect comparison logic in post-operation checks

The `_doCheckValueType` function, which is crucial for post-operation validation, contains reversed comparison logic for the `gte` (greater than or equal to) and `lte` (less than or equal to) operators. This reversal causes the function to perform the opposite checks than intended, potentially allowing operations to pass validation when they should fail, or fail when they should pass.

This issue could lead to:
1. Incorrect validation of CDP (Collateralized Debt Position) states after operations.
2. Potential manipulation of the system by exploiting these misaligned checks.

### Proof of Concept

The issue is located in the `_doCheckValueType` function of the LeverageMacroBase contract:

[LeverageMacroBase.sol#L277-L289](repos/2024-06-badger/ebtc-protocol/packages/contracts/contracts/LeverageMacroBase.sol#L277-L289)

Specifically, the problematic comparisons are:

```solidity
} else if (check.operator == Operator.gte) {
    require(check.value >= valueToCheck, "!LeverageMacroReference: gte post check");
} else if (check.operator == Operator.lte) {
    require(check.value <= valueToCheck, "!LeverageMacroReference: let post check");
}
```
