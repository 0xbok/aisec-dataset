## [M] `isolateRedeem()` revert in case Revert-on-zero-value-transfers tokens

One of the features of this protocol is that the borrower can redeem his loan (under the **Isolate Lending**) after his loan goes into auction state (before the end of the auction) by simply invoking `IsolateLiquidation.sol#isolateRedeem()`. However, in order to keep the liquidators incentivized to launch the auction for any bad debt, the borrower could get forced to pay them some fee (called `bidFine`).

The `bidFine` is defined by two factors `bidFineFactor` and `minBidFineFactor`, both of them are updatable from `Configurator.sol#setAssetAuctionParams()`,

In case admin set them to zero, when the borrower tries to redeem his loan this logic from `IsolateLogic.sol#executeIsolateRedeem()`:

```solidity
File: IsolateLogic.sol#executeIsolateRedeem()

328:       (, vars.bidFines[vars.nidx]) = GenericLogic.calculateNftLoanBidFine(
329:         debtAssetData,
330:         debtGroupData,
331:         nftAssetData,
332:         loanData,
333:         vars.priceOracle
334:       );

```

will set the value of `vars.bidFines[vars.nidx]` to zero. After that, the flow will enter this `IF` block to transfer the `bidFine` to the liquidator who launched the auction.

```solidity
File: IsolateLogic.sol#executeIsolateRedeem()

346:       if (loanData.firstBidder != address(0)) {
347:         // transfer bid fine from borrower to the first bidder
348:         VaultLogic.erc20TransferBetweenWallets(
349:           params.asset,
350:           params.msgSender,
351:           loanData.firstBidder,
352:           vars.bidFines[vars.nidx]
353:         );
354:       }
```

In case `params.asset` is one of Revert-on-Zero-Value-Transfers tokens (in scope),
the transaction will revert because it is trying to transfer zero value `vars.bidFines[vars.nidx] == 0`.

### Impact

The borrower will never be able to redeem his loan after his loan goes into auction state.
