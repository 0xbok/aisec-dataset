## [M] `YieldEthStakingLido` lacks a limit on the max stake amount, which may result in the unstake exceeding `MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT`, resulting in the token not being retrieved

In `YieldEthStakingLido`, the main processes are as follows:

1. `stake()` -> stEth balance increase
2. `unstake () -> unstETH.requestWithdrawals(allShares)`
3. `repay() -> unstETH.claimWithdrawal()`

The issue is the second step, `unstETH` is with a maximum withdrawal limit: `MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT`

```solidity
contract YieldEthStakingLido is YieldStakingBase {
...
  function protocolRequestWithdrawal(YieldStakeData storage sd) internal virtual override {
    IYieldAccount yieldAccount = IYieldAccount(yieldAccounts[msg.sender]);

    uint256[] memory requestAmounts = new uint256[](1);
    requestAmounts[0] = sd.withdrawAmount;
    bytes memory result = yieldAccount.execute(
      address(unstETH),
@>    abi.encodeWithSelector(IUnstETH.requestWithdrawals.selector, requestAmounts, address(yieldAccount))
    );
    uint256[] memory withdrawReqIds = abi.decode(result, (uint256[]));
    require(withdrawReqIds.length > 0 && withdrawReqIds[0] > 0, Errors.YIELD_ETH_WITHDRAW_FAILED);
    sd.withdrawReqId = withdrawReqIds[0];
  }
```

<https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/withdrawal-queue-erc721/#requestwithdrawals>

> each amount in `_amounts` must be greater than or equal to `MIN_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT` and lower than or equal to `MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT`.

Current configuration [here](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-dao/blob/master/contracts/0.8.9/WithdrawalQueue.sol#L57).

```solidity
    /// @notice maximum amount of stETH that is possible to withdraw by a single request
    /// Prevents accumulating too much funds per single request fulfillment in the future.
    /// @dev To withdraw larger amounts, it's recommended to split it to several requests
    uint256 public constant MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT = 1000 * 1e18;
```

`lido` suggests that if it exceeds this value, it needs to be taken in batches, but `YieldEthStakingLido.sol` can only be taken at once. If the stake amount exceeds this value, it will not be possible to `unstake()` and the `token` will be locked in the contract.

Assumption: `leverageFactor = 50000 , eth price = $2500`

As long as the value of the nft is greater than `1000 * $2500 / 5 = $500,000` it will be possible to `stake()` more than `MAX_STETH_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT`.
After that, when the user performs an `unstake()` it will fail, causing the token to be locked.

### Impact

Excessive amount of stake will result in failure to `unstake()`.
