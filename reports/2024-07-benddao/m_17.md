## [M] Changing auction duration will have effect on ongoing auctions

### Impact

Auctions created before the auction duration was changed will have their duration shortened/extended, which may catch their participants off guard.

### Proof of Concept

When an isolated position reaches it's liquidation threshold, users can put it up for auction to pay off the debt and take the collateral NFT. The auction has a fixed duration during which borrower can redeem the debt and if it doesn't happen, the last bidder will pay off the debt and receive the NFT at the end.

The `PoolAdmin` can customize the `auctionDuration` variable with the `setAssetAuctionParams` function. This can be a problem because the protocol checks whether the auction has ended as follows:

```solidity
      vars.auctionEndTimestamp = loanData.bidStartTimestamp + nftAssetData.auctionDuration;
      require(block.timestamp > vars.auctionEndTimestamp, Errors.ISOLATE_BID_AUCTION_DURATION_NOT_END);

      vars.auctionEndTimestamp = loanData.bidStartTimestamp + nftAssetData.auctionDuration;
      require(block.timestamp <= vars.auctionEndTimestamp, Errors.ISOLATE_BID_AUCTION_DURATION_HAS_END);
```

Thus, the new duration will be applied to auctions that were started before the duration change. For example, if the duration was shortened, some auctions will end prematurely, which may be unexpected for its participants.
