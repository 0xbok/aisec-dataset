## [M] No check if Arbitrum/Optimism L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds `PriceOracle.sol`

Chainlink recommends that all Optimistic L2 oracles consult the Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle.

If the Arbitrum Sequencer goes down, oracle data will not be kept up to date, and thus could become stale. However, users are able to continue to interact with the protocol directly through the L1 optimistic rollup contract. You can review Chainlink docs on [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds/) for more details on this.

This protocol uses `getPriceOracle()` everywhere and it sub call to [`PriceOracle.sol#latestRoundData()`](repos/2024-07-benddao/src/PriceOracle.sol#L122). As a result, users may be able to use the protocol while Oracle feeds are stale. This could cause many problems, for example:

- A user has a loan with 100 tokens, valued at 1 ETH each, and no borrows.
- The Arbitrum sequencer goes down temporarily.
- While it's down, the price of the token falls to 0.5 ETH each.
- The current value of the user's loan is 50 ETH, so the liquidators should be able to liquidate this position because it is unhealthy.
- However, due to the stale price, the protocol lets the user keep borrowing.

### Impact

If the Arbitrum sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) prices. This will break all the core functionality in the protocol.
