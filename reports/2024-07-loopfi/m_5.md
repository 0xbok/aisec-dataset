## [M] `PositionAction4626::increaseLever` will always revert

Users can use `PositionAction::increaseLever` to increase their positions' leverage, i.e., increasing both the collateral and debt, by taking a flash loan and doing some swaps. At the end of the process, after swapping "borrow" tokens to underlying tokens they should be returned to the vault under the position's "name".

For ERC20 collateral positions, this is happening in `PositionAction20::_onIncreaseLever` (that gets called in `PositionAction::onFlashLoan`) which approves the vault to spend some amount and then returns the amount to be later sent using the following in `PositionAction::onFlashLoan`:

```solidity
// add collateral and debt
ICDPVault(leverParams.vault).modifyCollateralAndDebt(
    leverParams.position,
    address(this),
    address(this),
    toInt256(collateral),
    toInt256(addDebt)
);
```

However, for ERC4626 collateral positions, `PositionAction4626::_onIncreaseLever` is both approving the amount and depositing it into the vault under `address(this)` which IS NOT the position's proxy but `PositionAction4626` contract as it is the flash loan callback function and isn't delegated like `increaseLever`. When `_onIncreaseLever` finishes, it'll try to deposit the collateral AGAIN in the vault using [this](relative_path_091409:src/proxy/PositionAction.sol#L416-L422); which will for sure revert, as the approval was spent and no funds are left to make the deposit.

This will cause `PositionAction4626::increaseLever` to always revert and never work, blocking users from leveraging their positions.

### Proof of Concept

```solidity

        vault = createCDPVault(stakingLPEth, 5_000_000 ether, 0, 1.25 ether, 1.0 ether, 1.05 ether);
        createGaugeAndSetGauge(address(vault));

        gauge.addQuotaToken(address(stakingLPEth), 10, 100);

        user = vm.addr(0x12341234);
        userProxy = PRBProxy(payable(address(prbProxyRegistry.deployFor(user))));

        positionAction = new PositionAction4626(
            address(flashlender),

    function test_increaseLeverDOS() public {
