## [H] Debt position interest is compounded while pool interest is simple causing inconsistency between `expectedLiquidity_` and `availableLiquidity_`

Borrower's will mostly end up paying more than the required amount of interest. This can also lead to lowered borrowing interest rates and final withdrawals to revert due to the inconsistency between the expected interest amount and the actually paid interest amount.

### Proof of Concept

The interest associated with a debt is calculated both in the pool and the user's debt position. However, the used method for calculation leads to different values between the pool and the debt position. In the pool it is simple linear interest, while for the debt position, the interest gets compounded.

In the pool the interest is calculated as `borrowed * interestRate * (elapsedTime/365 days)`:

[PoolV3.sol#L671-L673](relative_path_091409:src/PoolV3.sol#L671-L673)

```solidity
    function _calcBaseInterestAccrued(uint256 timestamp) private view returns (uint256) {
        return (_totalDebt.borrowed * baseInterestRate().calcLinearGrowth(timestamp)) / RAY;
    }
```

In the CDP vault (i.e., user's debt position), the interest is calculated as `debt * interestIndexNow / interestIndexPast - debt`:

[CDPVault.sol#L478](relative_path_091409:src/CDPVault.sol#L478)

```solidity
    function _calcDebt(Position memory position) internal view returns (DebtData memory cdd) {

        ....

        cdd.accruedInterest = CreditLogic.calcAccruedInterest(cdd.debt, cdd.cumulativeIndexLastUpdate, index);
```

[CreditLogic.sol#L31-L38](https://github.com/Gearbox-protocol/core-v3/blob/832fe64d7194ad74b93543b1314da38aa6d413ea/contracts/libraries/CreditLogic.sol#L31-L38)

```solidity
    function calcAccruedInterest(uint256 amount, uint256 cumulativeIndexLastUpdate, uint256 cumulativeIndexNow)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        if (amount == 0) return 0;
        return (amount * cumulativeIndexNow) / cumulativeIndexLastUpdate - amount; // U:[CL-1]
    }
```

Where the `interestIndex` is updated as follows:

[PoolV3.sol#L676-L678](relative_path_091409:src/PoolV3.sol#L676-L678)

```solidity
    function _calcBaseInterestIndex(uint256 timestamp) private view returns (uint256) {
        return (_baseInterestIndexLU * (RAY + baseInterestRate().calcLinearGrowth(timestamp))) / RAY;
    }
```

Hence, the `interestIndex` gets compounded with every invocation of `_calcBaseInterestIndex`, eventually causing a higher interest for the debt position when compared with the pool calculation. This also causes incorrectness between `expectedLiquidity_` and `availableLiquidity_` (i.e., `expectedLiquidity_` will be less than `availableLiquidity_`).

The correct relation between `expectedLiquidity_` and `availableLiquidity_` is required for `_updateBaseInterest` which is used throughout the contract for purposes like withdrawals:

```solidity
    function _withdraw(
        address receiver,
        address owner,
        uint256 assetsSent,
        uint256 assetsReceived,
        uint256 amountToUser,
        uint256 shares
    ) internal {
        if (msg.sender != owner) _spendAllowance({owner: owner, spender: msg.sender, amount: shares}); // U:[LP-8,9]
        _burn(owner, shares); // U:[LP-8,9]


        _updateBaseInterest({
            expectedLiquidityDelta: -assetsSent.toInt256(),
            availableLiquidityDelta: -assetsSent.toInt256(),
            checkOptimalBorrowing: false
        }); // U:[LP-8,9]
```

If the associated shares with the excess interest are withdrawn, it will cause an underflow for `expectedLiquidity` during final withdrawals

### POC Code

Apply the following diff and run `forge test --mt testHash_CompoundingVsSimpleInterest`. It is asserted that the calculated interest in the position is more than in the pool and that final withdrawals can revert due to this. The `minRate == 0` check in GaugeV3 contract is commented out in order to keep `quotaInterest` to 0 so that the only interest being accrued is the base interest, which will make it easier for displaying the difference in its calculation.
