### Impact

Either the profit or the loss is calculated incorrectly, resulting in the treasury owns incorrect profit balance.

### Proof of Concept

Anyone can deposit `WETH` for `lpETH` by calling `PoolV3#deposit()` or `PoolV3#mint()`.  The exchange rate of `WETH:lpETH` is `1:1`.
The eligible credit manager can borrow `WETH` by calling `PoolV3#lendCreditAccount()`, and repay the debt and profit lately by calling `PoolV3#repayCreditAccount()`.
The corresponding amount of `lpETH` will be minted to `treasury` if there is profit, and the corresponding amount of `lpETH` should be burned from `treasury` if there is any loss:

```solidity
        if (profit > 0) {
@>          _mint(treasury, convertToShares(profit)); // U:[LP-14B]
        } else if (loss > 0) {
            address treasury_ = treasury;
            uint256 sharesInTreasury = balanceOf(treasury_);
@>          uint256 sharesToBurn = convertToShares(loss);
            if (sharesToBurn > sharesInTreasury) {
                unchecked {
                    emit IncurUncoveredLoss({
                        creditManager: msg.sender,
                        loss: convertToAssets(sharesToBurn - sharesInTreasury)
                    }); // U:[LP-14D]
                }
                sharesToBurn = sharesInTreasury;
            }
            _burn(treasury_, sharesToBurn); // U:[LP-14C,14D]
        }
```

However, `convertToShares()` is used to calculate shares for profit and loss, while  `_convertToShares()` is used to calculate shares in [`PoolV3#deposit()`](relative_path_091409:src/PoolV3.sol#L243).
`convertToShares()` uses the exchange rate of `E4626` to calculate shares instead of `1:1` exchange rate defined in `PoolV3`.

The incorrect `convertToShares()` call could highly return less shares than expected, resulting in the treasury owning incorrect balance.
