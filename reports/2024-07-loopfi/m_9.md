## [M] `PendleLPOracle::_fetchAndValidate` uses Chainlink's deprecated `answeredInRound`

`PendleLPOracle` uses Chainlink to get the price of Pendle's underlying asset in ETH; this is done using `_fetchAndValidate`. That function uses `answeredInRound`, which is deprecated according to [Chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference#latestrounddata).

> `answeredInRound`:  Deprecated - Previously used when answers could take multiple rounds to be computed.

This results in invalid/wrong prices from Chainlink.
