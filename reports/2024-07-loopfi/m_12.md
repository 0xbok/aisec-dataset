## [M] Unclaimed rewards handling issue in `AuraVault` contract functions (`AuraVault::deposit`, `AuraVault::mint`, `AuraVault::withdraw` and `AuraVault::redeem`)

The `AuraVault` contract is designed to manage assets and distribute rewards from an Aura `RewardsPool`. The primary functions involved in asset management are `deposit()`, `mint()`, `withdraw()`, and `redeem()`. These functions rely on the [`totalAssets()` function](repos/2024-07-loopfi/src/vendor/AuraVault.sol#L175-L177) to calculate the total value of assets managed by the vault. However, the current implementation of `totalAssets()` does not account for unclaimed rewards, which can lead to incorrect calculations of shares and assets.

The `totalAssets()` function currently only returns the balance of the underlying asset in the reward pool:

```solidity
File: AuraVault.sol
175:     function totalAssets() public view virtual override(IERC4626, ERC4626) returns (uint256) {
176:         return IPool(rewardPool).balanceOf(address(this));
177:     }
```

This function does not include unclaimed rewards, which can be obtained using `IPool(rewardPool).earned(address(this))`. As a result, the `deposit()`, `mint()`, `withdraw()`, and `redeem()` functions may calculate shares and assets incorrectly, potentially causing users to receive more or fewer shares/assets than they should.

### Impact

The primary impact of this issue is that users may receive an incorrect number of shares or assets due to the inaccurate calculation of `totalAssets()`. This can lead to financial discrepancies, where some users may gain an unfair advantage while others may suffer losses. The severity of this issue is medium to high, depending on the extent of the financial impact on users. An incorrect `totalAssets()` value affects the accuracy of the `deposit()`, `mint()`, `withdraw()`, and `redeem()` functions, leading to an unfair distribution of assets.

### Proof of Concept

1. **User deposits assets:**
    - User calls `deposit(1000, receiver)`.
    - `totalAssets()` returns 10,000 (current balance in reward pool).
    - `previewDeposit(1000)` calculates shares based on 10,000 total assets.
    - Unclaimed rewards of 500 are not included, leading to an incorrect share calculation.

2. **User mints shares:**
    - User calls `mint(100, receiver)`.
    - `totalAssets()` returns 10,000 (current balance in reward pool).
    - `previewMint(100)` calculates assets based on 10,000 total assets.
    - Unclaimed rewards of 500 are not included, leading to an incorrect asset calculation.

3. **User withdraws assets:**
    - User calls `withdraw(1000, receiver, owner)`.
    - `totalAssets()` returns 10,000 (current balance in reward pool).
    - `previewWithdraw(1000)` calculates shares based on 10,000 total assets.
    - Unclaimed rewards of 500 are not included, leading to an incorrect share calculation.

4. **User redeems shares:**
    - User calls `redeem(100, receiver, owner)`.
    - `totalAssets()` returns 10,000 (current balance in reward pool).
    - `previewRedeem(100)` calculates assets based on 10,000 total assets.
    - Unclaimed rewards of 500 are not included, leading to an incorrect asset calculation.
