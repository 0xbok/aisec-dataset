## [H] An infinite loop in `MultiFeeDistribution.sol` withdraw

An infinite loop will block the withdraw process.

### Proof of Concept

In the MultiFeeDistribution.sol the `withdraw` function will start going through user's locked amounts if they do not have enough unlocked to cover their withdraw request:

```solidity
  if (amount <= bal.unlocked) {
            bal.unlocked = bal.unlocked - amount;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = amount - bal.unlocked;
            if (bal.earned < remaining) revert InvalidEarned();
            bal.unlocked = 0;
            uint256 sumEarned = bal.earned;
            uint256 i;
            for (i = 0; ; ) {
                uint256 earnedAmount = _userEarnings[_address][i].amount;
                if (earnedAmount == 0) continue;
```

However, as you can see it will stay at 0 and the following check will execute:

```solidity
  if (earnedAmount == 0) continue;
```

This continues and will start a new iteration of the loop; however, it will still be `0` and this loop will never end. As a result, claiming from locked amounts with penalty will not be possible.
