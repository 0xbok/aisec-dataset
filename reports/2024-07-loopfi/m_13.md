## [M] Lack of Slippage Control in `AuraVault::deposit` and `AuraVault::mint` Functions Can Lead to Unexpected Financial Losses for Users

The `AuraVault` contract implements ERC-4626 vault functionality, allowing users to deposit assets and mint shares. However, the `deposit` and `mint` functions lack slippage controls, which can result in users receiving fewer shares or sending more assets than expected. This issue is similar to a previously reported bug in the `bHermes` contract, where the absence of slippage controls in the `ERC4626DepositOnly.deposit` and `ERC4626DepositOnly.mint` functions led to unexpected outcomes for users.

### Detailed Description

The `AuraVault` contract is designed to manage assets and distribute rewards from an Aura `RewardsPool`. It includes functions for depositing assets and minting shares, which are critical for users interacting with the vault. However, these functions do not allow users to specify slippage parameters, exposing them to potential financial losses.

[`deposit` Function](relative_path_091409:src/vendor/AuraVault.sol#L199-L208)

The `deposit` function allows users to deposit a specified amount of assets and receive shares in return. The function calculates the number of shares to be minted using the `previewDeposit` function and then proceeds with the deposit. However, it does not allow users to specify a minimum number of shares to be minted, which can lead to slippage issues.

```solidity
File: AuraVault.sol
199:     function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public virtual override(IERC4626, ERC4626) returns (uint256) {
200:         uint256 shares = previewDeposit(assets);
201:         _deposit(_msgSender(), receiver, assets, shares);
202: 
203:         // Deposit  in reward pool
204:         IERC20(asset()).safeApprove(rewardPool, assets);
205:         IPool(rewardPool).deposit(assets, address(this));
206: 
207:         return shares;
208:     }
```

[`mint` Function](relative_path_091409:src/vendor/AuraVault.sol#L216-L225)

The `mint` function allows users to mint a specified number of shares by depositing the required amount of assets. The function calculates the required assets using the `previewMint` function and then proceeds with the minting. However, it does not allow users to specify a maximum number of assets to be sent, which can lead to slippage issues.

```solidity
File: AuraVault.sol
216:     function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) public virtual override(IERC4626, ERC4626) returns (uint256) {
217:         uint256 assets = previewMint(shares);
218:         _deposit(_msgSender(), receiver, assets, shares);
219: 
220:         // Deposit assets in reward pool
221:         IERC20(asset()).safeApprove(rewardPool, assets);
222:         IPool(rewardPool).deposit(assets, address(this));
223: 
224:         return assets;
225:     }
```

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is the absence of slippage control parameters in the `deposit` and `mint` functions. Users cannot specify minimum shares to be minted or maximum assets to be sent, leading to potential financial losses due to slippage.

### Impact

Users can lose funds due to unexpected slippage when interacting with the `AuraVault` contract. Specifically, they may receive fewer shares than expected when depositing assets or send more assets than expected when minting shares. This can result in significant financial losses, especially in volatile market conditions.

### Proof of Concept

1. Alice wants to deposit 1000 units of an asset into the `AuraVault` contract and expects to receive at least 100 shares.
2. Alice calls the `deposit` function with 1000 units of the asset.
3. Due to slippage, Alice receives only 90 shares instead of the expected 100 shares.
4. Alice loses value because she received fewer shares than expected.

Similarly, for the `mint` function:

1. Bob wants to mint 100 shares and expects to send no more than 1000 units of the asset.
2. Bob calls the `mint` function with 100 shares as the input.
3. Due to slippage, Bob ends up sending 1200 units of the asset instead of the expected 1000 units.
4. Bob loses value because he sent more assets than expected.
