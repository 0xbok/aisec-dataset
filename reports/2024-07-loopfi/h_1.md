## [H] `AuraVault::claim` reward calculation does not deduct fees from reward amount, causing DoS or extra rewards lost

`AuraVault::claim` allows users to claim rewards corresponding to the amount of `WETH` they are depositing in the same call.

Prior to sending rewards to `msg.sender`, a percentage of the rewards is sent to the `vault locker rewards`. However, the percentage of the rewards sent to the `vault locker rewards` is not deducted from the amount that is sent to the caller. The entire `reward amount` is sent to `msg.sender`.

This is problematic, as it creates two possible scenarios:

1. Contract attempts to send more reward tokens than it holds, causing DoS.
2. Contract successfully sends extra reward tokens, essentially stealing rewards from others.

Therefore, the impact ranges from `stolen funds` to `Denial of Service`.

### Proof of Concept

As users interact with the `AuraVault` contract, the contract will accumulate rewards through interaction with an external [rewards contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2a14db8d09db0542f6a371c0cb308a768227d67d#code), which acts as an ERC-4626 vault.

Users can deposit, withdraw, redeem, and *claim* rewards:

     */
    function claim(uint256[] memory amounts, uint256 maxAmountIn) external returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        // Claim rewards from Aura reward pool
        IPool(rewardPool).getReward();

        // Compute assets amount to be sent to the Vault
        VaultConfig memory _config = vaultConfig;
        amountIn = _previewReward(amounts[0], amounts[1], _config);

        // Transfer assets to Vault
        require(amountIn <= maxAmountIn, "!Slippage");
        IERC20(asset()).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountIn);

        // Compound assets into "asset" balance
        IERC20(asset()).safeApprove(rewardPool, amountIn);
        IPool(rewardPool).deposit(amountIn, address(this));

        // Distribute BAL rewards
@>      IERC20(BAL).safeTransfer(_config.lockerRewards, (amounts[0] * _config.lockerIncentive) / INCENTIVE_BASIS);
@>      IERC20(BAL).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amounts[0]);

        // Distribute AURA rewards
        if (block.timestamp <= INFLATION_PROTECTION_TIME) {
@>          IERC20(AURA).safeTransfer(_config.lockerRewards, (amounts[1] * _config.lockerIncentive) / INCENTIVE_BASIS);
@>          IERC20(AURA).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amounts[1]);
        } else {
            // after INFLATION_PROTECTION_TIME
            IERC20(AURA).safeTransfer(_config.lockerRewards, IERC20(AURA).balanceOf(address(this)));
        }

        emit Claimed(msg.sender, amounts[0], amounts[1], amountIn);
    }
```

Firstly, rewards are claimed from the `Aura reward pool`, proceeded by a call to `_previewReward()` to calculate the amount of `WETH` the caller must deposit to receive the amount of rewards they have specified.

The issue is with the transferring of rewards. We can see the `vault locker rewards` receives a percentage of the rewards, calculated by `(amounts[0] * _config.lockerIncentive) / INCENTIVE_BASIS)`.

However, the entire amount of rewards is still sent to the caller, without accounting for the percentage that was just sent to the `vault locker rewards`. Therefore, this call is sending extra rewards to the caller.

As mentioned, this leads to two scenarios:

1. DoS due to insufficient rewards.
2. Extra rewards successfully sent to the caller, essentially stealing rewards from others.

Consider the following scenario:

1. Alice decides to deposit `WETH` and claim `BAL` and `AURA` rewards via a call to `AuraVault::claim`. `_config.lockerIncentive` is set to 1000 and `INCENTIVE_BASIS` is set to 10000, effectively setting the fee portion to 10%.
2. Alice sets `amounts[0] = 100e18 BAL` and `amount[1] = 100e18 AURA`.
3. `IPool(rewardPool).getReward();` is called, setting the rewards held in the `AuraVault` contract to `100e18 BAL` and `100e18 AURA`.
4. `IERC20(BAL).safeTransfer(_config.lockerRewards, (amounts[0] * _config.lockerIncentive) / INCENTIVE_BASIS);` call sends `100e18 * 1000 / 10000 = 10e18` `BAL` tokens to `_config.lockerRewards`, which is the `vault locker rewards`.
5. The `AuraVault` contract now holds `90e18 BAL` and `100e18 AURA`.
6. `IERC20(BAL).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amounts[0]);` attempts to send `100e18 BAL` to `msg.sender`; however, `10e18` was already sent to `locker rewards`, so this call will DoS due to insufficient funds.

The call will revert in the case described above, and Alice would have to specify a lower amount of rewards (i.e., 50e18 BAL and AURA), but we can see that the contract will still send more rewards than intended, effectively stealing rewards from others.
