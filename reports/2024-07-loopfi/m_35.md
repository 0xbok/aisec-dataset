## [M] `PositionAction4626.sol#_onWithdraw` should withdraw from `position` CDPVault position instead of `address(this)`

In `PositionAction4626`, the `_onWithdraw` should withdraw the token from `position` CDPVault position. However, currently it withdraws from `address(this)`. This is inconsistent to the parent contract `PositionAction.sol`, which specifically states the operation should handle the `position` address.

Also, in contrast, we can check the `PositionAction20` contract, it withdraws from the `position` address.

PositionAction4626.sol:

```solidity
    function _onWithdraw(address vault, address /*position*/, address dst, uint256 amount) internal override returns (uint256) {
>       uint256 collateralWithdrawn = ICDPVault(vault).withdraw(address(this), amount);

        // if collateral is not the dst token, we need to withdraw the underlying from the ERC4626 vault
        address collateral = address(ICDPVault(vault).token());
        if (dst != collateral) {
            collateralWithdrawn = IERC4626(collateral).redeem(collateralWithdrawn, address(this), address(this));
        }

        return collateralWithdrawn;
    }
```

PositionAction20.sol:

```solidity
    function _onWithdraw(address vault, address position, address /*dst*/, uint256 amount) internal override returns (uint256) {
>       return ICDPVault(vault).withdraw(position, amount);
    }
```

PositionAction.sol:

```solidity
    /// @notice Hook to withdraw collateral from CDPVault, handles any CDP specific actions
    /// @param vault The CDP Vault
>   /// @param position The CDP Vault position
    /// @param dst Token the caller expects to receive
    /// @param amount The amount of collateral to deposit [wad]
    /// @return Amount of collateral (or dst) withdrawn [CDPVault.tokenScale()]
    function _onWithdraw(address vault, address position, address dst, uint256 amount) internal virtual returns (uint256);
```
