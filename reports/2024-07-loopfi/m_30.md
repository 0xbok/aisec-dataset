## [M] Usage of `lastEligibleStatus` can cause user to miss out on rewards on `manualStopEmissionsFor` invocation

Invoking `manualStopEmissionsFor` can cause the user to miss out on rewards from vaults even after the user becomes eligible.

### Proof of Concept

If `lastEligibleStatus` and `isCurrentlyEligible` returns true, only the balance of the specific vault is updated. The idea is that whenever both these are true, all the other balances would have already been updated to the current value and hence need not be re-queried again.

```solidity
    function handleActionAfter(address _user, uint256 _balance, uint256 _totalSupply) external {
        if (!validRTokens[msg.sender] && msg.sender != address(mfd)) revert NotRTokenOrMfd();


        if (_user == address(mfd) || eligibilityExempt[_user]) {
            return;
        }
        if (eligibilityMode == EligibilityModes.FULL) {
            bool lastEligibleStatus = eligibleDataProvider.lastEligibleStatus(_user);
            bool isCurrentlyEligible = eligibleDataProvider.refresh(_user);
            if (isCurrentlyEligible) {
                if (lastEligibleStatus) {
                    _handleActionAfterForToken(msg.sender, _user, _balance, _totalSupply);
                } else {
                    _updateRegisteredBalance(_user);
                }
            } else {
```

But this assumption is broken when `manualStopEmissionsFor` is called which will set the balance corresponding to each vault as 0:

```solidity
    function manualStopEmissionsFor(address _user, address[] memory _tokens) public isWhitelisted {
        if (_user == address(0)) revert AddressZero();
        uint256 length = _tokens.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < length; ) {
            address token = _tokens[i];
            
            ....

                uint256 newTotalSupply = pool.totalSupply - amount;
                user.amount = 0;
                user.rewardDebt = 0;
                pool.totalSupply = newTotalSupply;


                emit BalanceUpdated(token, _user, 0, newTotalSupply);
            }
```

In this case, if an user's vault position update makes the user eligible for rewards, only that specific vault associated debt will be earning rewards and all the other vault balances won't be updated.
