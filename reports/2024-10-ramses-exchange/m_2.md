## [M] The fee for the protocol in the function `RamsesV3Pool::flash()` is not calculated correctly

Because the fee for the protocol is not calculated correctly, the split of fees is wrong resulting in less fees for the protocol.

When calling the function [flash](relative_path_091409:contracts/CL/core/RamsesV3Pool.sol#L684-L725) on a RamsesV3Vault the caller initiates a flash loan. For the amount he flashes he needs to pay a fee. This fee is then divided between the protocol and the liquidity provider of the protocol. The issue arises from the fact how the share of the fees the protocol should get is calculated:

[RamsesV3Pool.sol#L713](contracts/CL/core/RamsesV3Pool.sol#L713):
```solidity
uint256 pFees0 = feeProtocol == 0 ? 0 : paid0 / feeProtocol;
```

The feeProtocol is a number between 0 and 100 representing the \% of fees the protocol should get, which is initially set to 80 meaning 80\% of the fees should go to the protocol. With the current calculation and the initial value of 80, the protocol would only get 1/80 of the fees instead of 80\% of the fees, contradicting the intended fee distribution and resulting in way less fees for the protocol than intended.
