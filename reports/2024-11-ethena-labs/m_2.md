## [M] Non-whitelisted users can burn UStb and redeem collateral during WHITELIST_ENABLED state

Non-whitelisted users can redeem collateral tokens and burn their UStb even when whitelist mode has been enabled on UStb contract. This breaks the main invariant mentioned in the [README](repos/2024-11-ethena-labs/README.md#additional-context).

The below code block is from the `\_beforeTokenTransfer() function()`, which is called at the beginning of the ERC20 \_burn() internal function. When the transferState is WHITELIST_ENABLED, it should only allow whitelisted users to burn their UStb as mentioned under the main invariants in the [README](repos/2024-11-ethena-labs/README.md#additional-context). But since the `from` address is not checked to have the `WHITELISTED_ROLE` as well, the call goes through.

        } else if (transferState == TransferState.WHITELIST_ENABLED) {
            if (hasRole(MINTER_CONTRACT, msg.sender) && !hasRole(BLACKLISTED_ROLE, from) && to == address(0)) {
