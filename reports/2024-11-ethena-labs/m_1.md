## [M] Blacklisted user can burn tokens during WHITELIST_ENABLED state

Blacklisted user can burn tokens during WHITELIST_ENABLED state. This breaks the main invariant from the [README](relative_path_091409:README.md#main-invariants). This could become an issue when the admin tries to redistribute the blacklisted user's UStb balance using `redistributeLockedAmount()` but the blacklisted user frontruns it with a burn.

According to the comment [here](relative_path_091409:contracts/ustb/UStb.sol#L209), it is possible for an address to be whitelisted and blacklisted at the same.

During the WHITELIST_ENABLED state, the code block below is checked when burning tokens to ensure only whitelisted addresses can burn their tokens. But since blacklisted users also have the whitelisted role as per the comment above, the condition evaluates to true and allows the blacklisted address to burn tokens.

             } else if (hasRole(WHITELISTED_ROLE, msg.sender) && hasRole(WHITELISTED_ROLE, from) && to == address(0)) {
                 // whitelisted user can burn
```
