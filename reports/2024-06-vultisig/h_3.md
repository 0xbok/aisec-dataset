## [H] Adversary can prevent the launch of any ILO pool with enough raised capital at any moment by providing single-sided liquidity

<relative_path_091409:src/ILOPool.sol#L296>

### Impact

It is possible to prevent the launch of any ILO pool at any time, including pools that have reached their total raised amount. This can be done at any time and the cost for the attacker is negligible.

Not only this is a DOS of the whole protocol, but the attack can be performed at the very end of the sale, making users lose a lot on gas fees, considering it will be deployed on Ethereum Mainnet. Hundreds or thousands of users will participate in ILO pools via `buy()`, and will have to later call `claimRefund()` to get their "raise" tokens back.

Token launches that were deemed to be successful will be blocked after raising funds from many users, and this will most certainly affect the perception of the token, and its pricing on any attempt of a future launch/sale.

### Vulnerability Details

The `ILOManager` contract has a check to assert that the price at the time of the token launch is the same as the one initialized by the project. If they differ the transaction will revert, and the token launch will fail:

```solidity
function launch(address uniV3PoolAddress) external override {
    require(block.timestamp > _cachedProject[uniV3PoolAddress].launchTime, "LT");
    (uint160 sqrtPriceX96, , , , , , ) = IUniswapV3Pool(uniV3PoolAddress).slot0();
@>  require(_cachedProject[uniV3PoolAddress].initialPoolPriceX96 == sqrtPriceX96, "UV3P");
    address[] memory initializedPools = _initializedILOPools[uniV3PoolAddress];
    require(initializedPools.length > 0, "NP");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < initializedPools.length; i++) {
        IILOPool(initializedPools[i]).launch();
    }

    emit ProjectLaunch(uniV3PoolAddress);
}
```

<relative_path_091409:src/ILOManager.sol#L190>

The problem is that `sqrtPriceX96` can be easily manipulated in Uniswap v3 Pools when there is no liquidity in it via a swap with no cost. In theory, this could be mitigated by anyone by swapping back to get back to the original price. But there is an additional problem which makes the severity of the attack even higher. The attacker can add [single-sided liquidity](https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/20902968738317-What-is-single-sided-liquidity#:\~:text=When%20you%20select%20a%20range%20that%20is%20outside%20the%20current%20price%20range%2C%20you%20will%20only%20be%20able%20to%20supply%20one%20of%20the%20two%20tokens.) to the pool (just the Raise Token) after the price was manipulated.

> When you select a range that is outside the current price range, you will only be able to supply one of the two tokens.

By adding liquidity in ticks greater than the manipulated price, but lower than the expected initial price, it would require the swapper to provide some `SALE_TOKEN`, which should not be available at this moment, since they should all be in the ILO pool.

Even if the project admin has some `SALE_TOKEN`, the attacker can mint a higher amount of liquidity by providing more single-sided `RAISE_TOKEN` liquidity, making the needed amount of `SALE_TOKEN` even higher.

### Proof of Concept

The following Proof of Concept shows how an attacker can make a launch revert after raising capital, at the cost of providing liquidity with only `1 wei` of USDC (Raise Token).

Console Output:

    <<Minting Attack>>
    <<Failed mitigation attempt>>

    uniswapV3SwapCallback()
      amount0 (USDC)       0
      amount1 (SALE_TOKEN) 1

This would be enough to perform an attack that can't be reverted in most cases since no other sale tokens should be circulating before the launch. But for the sake of interest, the minted liquidity and the mitigation amount can be increased to check the values needed to get back to the initial price in different situations.

POC:

1. Add the import to the top of `test/ILOManager.t.sol`.
2. Add the test to the `ILOManagerTest` contract in `test/ILOManager.t.sol`.
3. Run `forge test --mt testManipulatePriceForLaunch -vv`.
