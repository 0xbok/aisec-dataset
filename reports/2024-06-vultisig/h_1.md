## [H] Most users won't be able to claim their share of Uniswap fees

Users should be able to claim Uniswap fees for their current liquidity position regardless of their pending vestings, or cliff. But most users won't be able to claim those Uniswap fees.

It is also possible that they won't be able to claim their vesting if they accumulate sufficient unclaimed Uniswap fees.

### Vulnerability Details

The root issue is that the `claim()` function collects ALL the owed tokens at once, including the ones from the burnt liquidity, but also the fees corresponding to ALL positions:

```solidity
    (uint128 amountCollected0, uint128 amountCollected1) = pool.collect(
        address(this),
        TICK_LOWER,
        TICK_UPPER,
@>      type(uint128).max,
@>      type(uint128).max
    );
```

<relative_path_091409:src/ILOPool.sol#L246-L247>

Then the platform fees are sent alongside the Uniswap fees from the users that still didn't claim `amountCollected - amount`:

```solidity
TransferHelper.safeTransfer(_cachedPoolKey.token0, feeTaker, amountCollected0-amount0);
TransferHelper.safeTransfer(_cachedPoolKey.token1, feeTaker, amountCollected1-amount1);
```

<relative_path_091409:src/ILOPool.sol#L252-L260>

The next time a user calls `claim()`, `pool.collect()` will not contain any Uniswap fees as all of them have already been claimed and sent to the first claimer and the rest to the fee taker. If the platform fees are enough to cover the owed fees for the claiming user, the transaction might succeed (this may be possible if the burnt liquidity is enough).

As time passes, more fees will be accumulated, and when Uniswap fees `>` platform fees, the transaction will also revert even for unclaimed vestings with liquidity to burn. In addition, in most cases after the initial vesting, users won't be able to claim Uniswap fees, as no fees will be collected, and the contract doesn't hold those assets (they have been sent to the fee taker).

### Proof of Concept

This POC shows how after one user claims their share of the fees, there are no more fee tokens to collect for the next claims, and the transactions revert.

1. Add the import to the top of `test/ILOPool.t.sol`.
2. Add the test to the `ILOPoolTest` contract in `test/ILOPool.t.sol`.
3. Run `forge test --mt testClaimFeesRevert`.

```solidity
import '../lib/v3-core/contracts/interfaces/IUniswapV3Pool.sol';
```

```solidity
function testClaimFeesRevert() external {
    _launch();
    vm.warp(VEST_START_0 + 10);

    uint256 tokenId = IILOPool(iloPool).tokenOfOwnerByIndex(INVESTOR, 0);
    uint256 tokenId2 = IILOPool(iloPool).tokenOfOwnerByIndex(INVESTOR_2, 0);

    IUniswapV3Pool uniV3Pool = IUniswapV3Pool(projectId);

    // INVESTOR and INVESTOR_2 burn their liquidity and obtain their tokens

    vm.prank(INVESTOR);
    IILOPool(iloPool).claim(tokenId);

    vm.prank(INVESTOR_2);
    IILOPool(iloPool).claim(tokenId2);

    // Generate some fees via a flash loan
    uniV3Pool.flash(address(this), 1e8, 1e8, "");

    // INVESTOR claims their corresponding part of the fees
    // Only the first one to claim has better odds of claiming successfully
    vm.prank(INVESTOR);
    IILOPool(iloPool).claim(tokenId);

    // INVESTOR_2 can't claim their part of the fees as the transaction will revert
    // It reverts with ST (SafeTransfer) as it is trying to transfer tokens the contract doesn't have
    // The fees for INVESTOR_2 were already taken
    vm.prank(INVESTOR_2);
    vm.expectRevert(bytes("ST"));
    IILOPool(iloPool).claim(tokenId2);

    // Generate more fees
    uniV3Pool.flash(address(this), 1e6, 1e6, "");

    // Even if some new fees are available, they might not be enough to pay back the owed ones to INVESTOR_2
    vm.prank(INVESTOR_2);
    vm.expectRevert(bytes("ST"));
    IILOPool(iloPool).claim(tokenId2);
}

function uniswapV3FlashCallback(uint256, uint256, bytes memory) external {
    deal(USDC, address(this), IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(address(this)) * 2);
    deal(SALE_TOKEN, address(this), IERC20(SALE_TOKEN).balanceOf(address(this)) * 2);

    IERC20(USDC).transfer(projectId, IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(address(this)));
    IERC20(SALE_TOKEN).transfer(projectId, IERC20(SALE_TOKEN).balanceOf(address(this)));
}
```
