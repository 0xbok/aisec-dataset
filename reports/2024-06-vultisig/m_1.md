## [M] Vultisig should be burnable

The Vultisig token, as described in its documentation, is expected to include a burnable feature. However, the current implementation of the Vultisig token contract lacks the necessary functions to support token burning. This report identifies the impact of this missing functionality and provides a recommended solution to implement the burn feature. The vultisig stated that they forgot to add this functionality.

### Impact

**Non-compliance with Documentation:** Users and developers relying on the documentation will expect burn functionality, leading to confusion and potential loss of trust when they find it missing.

### Proof of concept

As you can see from the code below function for burning is missing, consider adding it to the code.

    }

    function approveAndCall(
        address spender,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata extraData
    ) external returns (bool) {
        // Approve the spender to spend the tokens
        _approve(msg.sender, spender, amount);

        // Call the receiveApproval function on the spender contract
        IApproveAndCallReceiver(spender).receiveApproval(
            msg.sender,
            amount,
            address(this),
            extraData
        );

        return true;
    }
}
