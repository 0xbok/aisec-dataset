## [M] Vultisig should be burnable

The Vultisig token, as described in its documentation, is expected to include a burnable feature. However, the current implementation of the Vultisig token contract lacks the necessary functions to support token burning. This report identifies the impact of this missing functionality and provides a recommended solution to implement the burn feature. The vultisig stated that they forgot to add this functionality.

**Non-compliance with Documentation:** Users and developers relying on the documentation will expect burn functionality, leading to confusion and potential loss of trust when they find it missing.

### Proof of concept

As you can see from the code below function for burning is missing, consider adding it to the code.
