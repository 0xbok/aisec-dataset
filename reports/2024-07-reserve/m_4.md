## [M] Dutch auctions can fail to settle if any other collateral in the basket behaves unexpectedly

When a Dutch auction that originated from the backing manager receives a bid, it [calls](relative_path_091409:contracts/plugins/trading/DutchTrade.sol#L222) `BackingManager.settleTrade()` to settle the auction immediately, which [attempts to chain](relative_path_091409:contracts/p1/BackingManager.sol#L92) into another `rebalance()` call. This chaining is implemented using a try-catch block that attempts to catch out-of-gas errors.

However, this pattern is not safe because empty error data does not always indicate an out-of-gas error. Other types of errors also return no data, such as calls to empty addresses casted as contracts and revert / require statements with no error message.

The `rebalance()` function interacts with multiple external assets and performs several operations that can throw empty errors:

1.  In `basketsHeldBy()`, which calls `_quantity()`, which in turn calls `coll.refPerTok()` (this function should in theory [never revert](relative_path_091409:docs/collateral.md#refpertok-reftok), but in case it interacts with the underlying ERC20, its implementation may have been upgraded to one that does).
2.  In `prepareRecollateralizationTrade()`, which calls `basketRange()`, which also calls `_quantity()`.
3.  In `tryTrade()` if a new rebalancing trade is indeed chained, which calls `approve()` on the token via `AllowanceLib.safeApproveFallbackToMax()`. This is a direct interaction with the token and hence cannot be trusted, especially if the possibility of [upgradeability](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-reserve/tree/3f133997e186465f4904553b0f8e86ecb7bbacbf?tab=readme-ov-file#erc20-token-behaviors-in-scope) is considered.

If any of these operations result in an empty error, the auction settlement will fail. This can lead to the Dutch auction being unable to settle at a fair price.

Note: we have found [this](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-06-reserve-findings/issues/8) finding pointing out the very same issue in a previous audit, but this report highlights a different root cause in where the error originates.

### Impact

Dutch auctions may fail to settle at the appropriate price or at all.

### Proof of Concept

1.  A Dutch auction is initiated for rebalancing collateral.
2.  After some time, a bidder attempts to submit a bid at fair market value.
3.  `BackingManager.settleTrade()` is called by the trade contract.
4.  The `rebalance()` function is called within the try-catch block.
5.  The underlying ERC-20 of one of the collateral assets in the basket has an empty revert clause that currently throws when one of its functions is called.
6.  The catch block receives an empty error and reverts the transaction.
