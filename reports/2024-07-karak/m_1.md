## [M] Changing the `slashingHandler` for `NativeVaults` will DoS slashing

Relevant code: [NativeVault::slashAssets](repos/2024-07-karak/src/NativeVault.sol#L308)

### Description

`Core`'s state contains a mapping between assets and slashingHandlers - `assetSlashingHandlers`. Assets that are assigned a slashing handler are considered whitelisted and vaults containing this asset can be deployed.

When a slash is performed on a vault, the following function is called:

```js
function slashAssets(
	uint256 slashPercentageWad, address slashingHandler
) external returns (uint256 transferAmount);
```

Inside `NativeVault`'s implementation of the function, the following check is performed:

```js
if (slashingHandler != self.slashStore) revert NotSlashStore();
```

This check can be problematic in the case where some number of native vaults have been deployed and the `assetSlashingHandlers` mapping gets updated with a new `slashHandler`. Then, the `slashAssets` function will always revert.

### Root Cause

Unsynchronized state update causes DoS of slashing functionality inside `NativeVault`.

### Impact

If the `slashingHandler` for restaking gets changed at some point it will cause DoS of the slashing functionality for `NativeVaults`. It will be blocked until contracts get updated with new implementation or old slashing handler is restored.

> The issue could be exacerbated if some new `NativeVaults` get deployed with the new slash handler. Then, reverting to the old slash handler will break the newly deployed `NativeVaults`, making update implementation the only option to fix this issue. But this is also troublesome because only normal `Vaults` can have they're implementation updated for all deployments with one call. `NativeVaults` would have to be updated one by one.

### Proof of Concept

Let's suppose the following scenario:

1.  SlashHandler `A` is set for key `Constants.DEAD_BEEF` in `assetSlashingHandlers`.
2.  5 `NativeVaults` get deployed with this slash handler.
3.  SlashHandler `B` is set for `Constants.DEAD_BEEF`.
4.  These 5 `NativeVaults` would not be slashable until some measures are taken - either `A` restored or the vault's implementations are updated.

Both approaches to fix this issue once it has occurred have their drawbacks:

* If after **step 3**, more `NativeVaults` are created updating the allowlist will always cause some group of native vaults to be **unslashable**.
* Changing the `NativeVault` implementations can only be done only 1 by 1, since the default vault implementation is for normal `Vault`.

### Suggested Mitigation

There are multiple ways to prevent this issue:

* Function only callable by `Manager` to change `slashStore`
* Function in `Core` that is callable by anyone which changes the underlying `slashStore` of a `NativeVault` if there is a difference. Allowing users to unDoS themselves.
* Remove the check causing the revert in `slashAssets` and allow `NativeVaults` to have different `slashHandlers` if this is acceptable.
