## [M] When malicious behavior occurs and DSS requests slashing against vault during 2 day period after `SLASHING_WINDOW` of 7 days is passed after staker initiates a withdrawal, token amount to be slashed is calculated to be higher than what it should be

### Impact

According to <https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-karak?tab=readme-ov-file#stakers>, `Stakers can initiate a withdrawal, subject to a ``MIN_WITHDRAW_DELAY`` of 9 days`, and `DSS can slash any malicious behavior occurring before the withdrawal initiation for up to 7 days`. Since `MIN_WITHDRAW_DELAY` equals `SLASHING_WINDOW + SLASHING_VETO_WINDOW`, the staker's withdrawal should be safe without being associated with any malicious behavior and hence not slashable when the DSS does not request any slashing against the corresponding vault within the `SLASHING_WINDOW` of 7 days after such withdrawal is initiated.

<relative_path_091409:src/interfaces/Constants.sol#L13-L16>

```solidity
    uint256 public constant SLASHING_WINDOW = 7 days;
    uint256 public constant SLASHING_VETO_WINDOW = 2 days;
    uint256 public constant MIN_STAKE_UPDATE_DELAY = SLASHING_WINDOW + SLASHING_VETO_WINDOW;
    uint256 public constant MIN_WITHDRAWAL_DELAY = SLASHING_WINDOW + SLASHING_VETO_WINDOW;
```

During the 2 day period after the `SLASHING_WINDOW` of 7 days is passed after the staker's withdrawal is initiated, such as when just couple minutes are passed after such `SLASHING_WINDOW` is reached, the staker's withdrawal cannot be finished but a malicious behavior can occur and the DSS can make a slashing request against the corresponding vault; in this situation, the staker's withdrawal mentioned previously should not be subject to such slashing though. At that time, when the DSS calls the `Core.requestSlashing` function, which further calls the `SlasherLib.requestSlashing` and `SlasherLib.fetchEarmarkedStakes` functions, the token amount to be slashed is calculated as the DSS's allowed slashing percentage of the vault's `totalAssets()`, which includes the token amount corresponding to the staker's withdrawal. Because the staker's withdrawal should not be slashable, the token amount to be slashed actually should be the DSS's allowed slashing percentage of a value that equals the vault's `totalAssets()` minus the token amount corresponding to the staker's withdrawal. Thus, the DSS can unfairly slash more underlying token amount from the vault than it should be allowed.

<relative_path_091409:src/entities/SlasherLib.sol#L94-L124>

```solidity
    function requestSlashing(
        CoreLib.Storage storage self,
        IDSS dss,
        SlashRequest memory slashingMetadata,
        uint256 nonce
    ) external returns (QueuedSlashing memory queuedSlashing) {
        validateRequestSlashingParams(self, slashingMetadata, dss);
        uint256[] memory earmarkedStakes = fetchEarmarkedStakes(slashingMetadata);
        queuedSlashing = QueuedSlashing({
            dss: dss,
            timestamp: uint96(block.timestamp),
            operator: slashingMetadata.operator,
            vaults: slashingMetadata.vaults,
            earmarkedStakes: earmarkedStakes,
            nonce: nonce
        });
        self.slashingRequests[calculateRoot(queuedSlashing)] = true;
        ...
    }
```

<relative_path_091409:src/entities/SlasherLib.sol#L79-L92>

```solidity
    function fetchEarmarkedStakes(SlashRequest memory slashingMetadata)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256[] memory earmarkedStakes)
    {
        earmarkedStakes = new uint256[](slashingMetadata.vaults.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < slashingMetadata.vaults.length; ++i) {
            earmarkedStakes[i] = Math.mulDiv(
                slashingMetadata.slashPercentagesWad[i],
                IKarakBaseVault(slashingMetadata.vaults[i]).totalAssets(),
                Constants.MAX_SLASHING_PERCENT_WAD
            );
        }
    }
```

Moreover, when the `MIN_WITHDRAW_DELAY` of 9 days is passed after the staker's withdrawal is initiated, the staker can call the `Vault.finishRedeem` function for finishing his withdrawal request. Since `SLASHING_VETO_WINDOW` is 2 days, the DSS can call the `Core.finalizeSlashing` function for finalizing its slashing request just after the `MIN_WITHDRAW_DELAY` of 9 days is passed after the initiation of the staker's withdrawal if the DSS's slashing request was made when just couple minutes were passed after the `SLASHING_WINDOW` for such withdrawal of the staker was reached. Because both the staker's `Vault.finishRedeem` transaction and the DSS's `Core.finalizeSlashing` transaction are sent at the similar time, a malicious miner can place and execute the DSS's `Core.finalizeSlashing` transaction before the staker's `Vault.finishRedeem` transaction. In this case, the staker's withdrawal can be unfairly slashed by the DSS even though it should not be slashed.

<relative_path_091409:src/Vault.sol#L157-L188>

```solidity
    function finishRedeem(bytes32 withdrawalKey)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenFunctionNotPaused(Constants.PAUSE_VAULT_FINISH_REDEEM)
    {
        (VaultLib.State storage state, VaultLib.Config storage config) = _storage();

        WithdrawLib.QueuedWithdrawal memory startedWithdrawal = state.validateQueuedWithdrawal(withdrawalKey);
        ...
    }
```

<relative_path_091409:src/entities/VaultLib.sol#L24-L38>

```solidity
    function validateQueuedWithdrawal(State storage self, bytes32 withdrawalKey)
        internal
        view
        returns (WithdrawLib.QueuedWithdrawal memory qdWithdrawal)
    {
        qdWithdrawal = self.withdrawalMap[withdrawalKey];
        ...
        if (qdWithdrawal.start + Constants.MIN_WITHDRAWAL_DELAY > block.timestamp) {
            revert MinWithdrawDelayNotPassed();
        }
    }
```

<relative_path_091409:src/Core.sol#L248-L256>

```solidity
    function finalizeSlashing(SlasherLib.QueuedSlashing memory queuedSlashing)
        external
        nonReentrant
        whenFunctionNotPaused(Constants.PAUSE_CORE_FINALIZE_SLASHING)
    {
        _self().finalizeSlashing(queuedSlashing);
        ...
    }
```

<relative_path_091409:src/entities/SlasherLib.sol#L126-L151>

```solidity
    function finalizeSlashing(CoreLib.Storage storage self, QueuedSlashing memory queuedSlashing) external {
        ...
        if (queuedSlashing.timestamp + Constants.SLASHING_VETO_WINDOW > block.timestamp) {
            revert MinSlashingDelayNotPassed();
        }
        ...
    }
```

### Proof of Concept

The following steps can occur for the first described scenario where the DSS unfairly slashes more underlying token amount from the vault than it should be allowed.

1.  The vault holds `100` underlying tokens and has only one staker who owns `100` shares.
2.  On Day 0, the staker initiates his withdrawal for redeeming `50` shares.
3.  During the `SLASHING_WINDOW` of 7 days between Day 0 and Day 7, no malicious behavior occurs, and the DSS does not request any slashing against the vault.
    *   Therefore, the staker's withdrawal is safe and should not be slashable, and the staker should receive `50 * 100 / 100 = 50` underlying tokens for his withdrawal.
4.  On Day 8, a malicious behavior occurs, and the DSS with a 50% allowed slashing percentage requests to slash the vault.
    *   The token amount to be slashed by the DSS is calculated to be `50% * 100 = 50` underlying tokens.
    *   However, because the staker's withdrawal initiated on Day 0 should not be subject to such slashing, the token amount to be slashed by the DSS should equal `50% * (100 - 50) = 25` underlying tokens.
5.  On Day 9, the `MIN_WITHDRAW_DELAY` of 9 days is passed after the initiation of the staker's withdrawal so the staker finishes his withdrawal and does receive `50 * 100 / 100 = 50` underlying tokens from the vault.
6.  On Day 10, the DSS finalizes the slashing and slashes `50` underlying tokens calculated on Day 8, which is more than `25` underlying tokens that it should slash, from the vault. Therefore, the DSS unfairly slashes more underlying tokens from the vault than it should be allowed.

The following steps can occur for the second described scenario where the staker's withdrawal can be unfairly slashed by the DSS even though it should not be slashed.

1.  The vault holds `150` underlying tokens and has two stakers in which Staker A owns `100` shares and Staker B owns `50` shares.
2.  On Day 0, Staker A initiates his withdrawal for redeeming `100` shares.
3.  During the `SLASHING_WINDOW` of 7 days between Day 0 and Day 7, no malicious behavior occurs, and the DSS does not request any slashing against the vault.
    *   Therefore, Staker A's withdrawal is safe and should not be slashable, and Staker A should receive `100 * 150 / (100 + 50) = 100` underlying tokens for his withdrawal.
4.  A malicious behavior occurs when 3 minutes are passed after Day 7 starts, and the DSS with a 50% allowed slashing percentage requests to slash the vault when 5 minutes are passed after Day 7 starts.
    *   The token amount to be slashed by the DSS is calculated to be `50% * 150 = 75` underlying tokens.
    *   However, because Staker A's withdrawal initiated on Day 0 should not be subject to such slashing, the token amount to be slashed by the DSS should equal `50% * (150 - 100) = 25` underlying tokens.
5.  On Day 9, the `MIN_WITHDRAW_DELAY` of 9 days is passed after the initiation of Staker A's withdrawal so the staker calls the `Vault.finishRedeem` function for finishing his withdrawal.
6.  When 5 minutes are passed after Day 9 starts, the DSS calls the `Core.finalizeSlashing` function for finalizing the slashing.
7.  Both Staker A's `Vault.finishRedeem` transaction and the DSS's `Core.finalizeSlashing` transaction are sent at the similar time, a malicious miner places and executes the DSS's `Core.finalizeSlashing` transaction before Staker A's `Vault.finishRedeem` transaction.
8.  When the DSS's `Core.finalizeSlashing` transaction is executed, the DSS slashes `75` underlying tokens calculated in Step 4, which is more than `25` underlying tokens that it should slash, from the vault.
9.  When Staker A's `Vault.finishRedeem` transaction is executed, Staker A receives `100 * (150 - 75) / (100 + 50) = 50` underlying tokens, which is less than `100` underlying tokens that it should receive for his withdrawal, from the vault. Therefore, Staker A's withdrawal is unfairly slashed by the DSS even though it should not be slashed.
