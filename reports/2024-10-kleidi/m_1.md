The timelock acts in a way that once the proposals are submitted, they need to be cancelled or executed. This behaviour opens up a griefing attack vector towards the owners of the vault in case at least `threshold` amount of owners' private keys are exposed.

When the keys are exposed, the attackers can send as many transactions as they need to the network from the safe with different salts. Even if one of the transactions go through, funds can be stolen. The protocol defence mechanisms in these situations is (1) Pause guardian can cancel all the proposals (2) Cold signers can cancel proposals.

Both these defence mechanisms require gas usage from the victim's accounts, and it is important to note that they can not use the funds inside the Kleidi wallet. This can lead to a gas war between attackers and the victims and can cause them to at least cause a griefing attack.

### Impact

Assumption in this section is that the victims do not get external help and they have invested most of their liquidity inside Kleidi, and only kept minimal amounts out for gas payments.

*   Imagine if victims have access to `F` amounts of funds, and 95% of those funds is locked into Kleidi.
*   The proof of concept below shows that the gas consumption of `cancel` is close to 5% of `schedule`.
*   In case the keys are compromised, attackers can send many transactions spending `G` amount of gas. The requires the victims to need to spend `0.05 * G` in gas to cancel those proposals.
*   The reward for attackers, only if one of their transactions go through, is `0.95 * F`.
*   Given that victims only have access to `0.05 * F` to pay for `0.05 * G`, if attackers pay more than the funds inside the protocol, meaning (`G > F`), they can claim the funds in the protocol and drain it as victims do not have enough funds to cancel all proposals.

At the end, attackers can re-claim most of what they spent. Overall spending `G - 0.95 * F = G - 0.95 * G = 0.05 * G`, and steal `0.95 * G` from the user.

Note: In case the victims have invested more than `~95%` into the Kleidi, attackers will be able to make profit.
