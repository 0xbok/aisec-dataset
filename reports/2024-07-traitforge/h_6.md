## [H] `mintToken()`, `mintWithBudget()`, and `forge()` in the `TraitForgeNft` contract will fail due to a wrong modifier used in `EntropyGenerator.initializeAlphaIndices()`

The `EntropyGenerator` contract has an issue where the `initializeAlphaIndices()` function uses the wrong modifier. This function is supposed to be called by the `TraitForgeNft` contract, but it currently uses the `onlyOwner` modifier instead of `onlyAllowedCaller`.

### Impact

The `initializeAlphaIndices()` function will not be callable by the `TraitForgeNft` contract as intended. This could lead to failures in the expected functionality of the system, particularly in scenarios where the indices need to be initialized or updated by the `TraitForgeNft` contract while performing minting or forging. That means this vulnerability will cause DoS on `mintToken()`, `mintWithBudget()` and `forge()`.

### Proof of Concept

The function `initializeAlphaIndices()` is intended to be called by the `TraitForgeNft` contract. However, it is currently protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier. This means only the owner of the `EntropyGenerator` contract can call it, not the `TraitForgeNft` contract. The correct modifier should be `onlyAllowedCaller`, which restricts the function to be called by the address set as the `allowedCaller`.

The vulnerability lies in the following line of `EntropyGenerator` contract:

```solidity
@>  function initializeAlphaIndices() public whenNotPaused onlyOwner {
```

[contracts/EntropyGenerator/EntropyGenerator.sol#L206](repos/2024-07-traitforge/contracts/EntropyGenerator/EntropyGenerator.sol#L206)

The above `initializeAlphaIndices()` is called by `TraitForgeNft._incrementGeneration()`:

```solidity
  function _incrementGeneration() private {
    require(
      generationMintCounts[currentGeneration] >= maxTokensPerGen,
      'Generation limit not yet reached'
    );
    currentGeneration++;
    generationMintCounts[currentGeneration] = 0;
    priceIncrement = priceIncrement + priceIncrementByGen;
@>  entropyGenerator.initializeAlphaIndices();
    emit GenerationIncremented(currentGeneration);
  }
```

[contracts/TraitForgeNft/TraitForgeNft.sol#L353](repos/2024-07-traitforge/contracts/TraitForgeNft/TraitForgeNft.sol#L353)

Some of the important functions defined in `TraitForgeNft` contract, such as `mintToken()`, `mintWithBudget()` and `forge()`, internally use  `_incrementGeneration()`. Due to this vulnerability, the execution of these mentioned functions will fail.
