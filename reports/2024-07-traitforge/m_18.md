## [M] Excess ETH from `forgingFee` can get stuck in `EntityForging` under certain situations

ETH being permanently locked in the contract under certain situations.

### Description

The `forgeWithListed` function contains a vulnerability in the fee checking mechanism. The line that checks the forging fee allows users to send more ETH than the required amount. Normally, users would want to send the exact amount of the forging fee to avoid overpayment. However, if the forging fee is somehow reduced between the time a user initiates a transaction and when it's executed, the excess ETH becomes permanently locked in the contract.

See: [EntityForging.sol#L102-L175](relative_path_091409:contracts/EntityForging/EntityForging.sol#L102-L175):

```solidity
uint256 forgingFee = _forgerListingInfo.fee;
require(msg.value >= forgingFee, 'Insufficient fee for forging');

// ... (later in the function)

uint256 devFee = forgingFee / taxCut;
uint256 forgerShare = forgingFee - devFee;
address payable forgerOwner = payable(nftContract.ownerOf(forgerTokenId));

// ... (fee distribution)
(bool success, ) = nukeFundAddress.call{ value: devFee }('');
require(success, 'Failed to send to NukeFund');
(bool success_forge, ) = forgerOwner.call{ value: forgerShare }('');
require(success_forge, 'Failed to send to Forge Owner');
```

The `>=` check in the `require` statement allows for overpayment, but the contract only distributes the exact `forgingFee` amount, leaving excess ETH locked in the contract.

Here is an example of a scenario that could get the fund stuck from allowing overpayment:

1. Bob lists his forger entity with a fee of 0.1 ETH.
2. Alice initiates a transaction to forge with Bob's entity, sending exactly 0.1 ETH.
3. Alice's transaction is delayed or stuck due to gas price fluctuations or other network conditions.
4. Before Alice's transaction is executed, Bob reduces his forging fee to 0.08 ETH.
5. Alice's transaction is finally executed after the fee reduction.
6. The contract accepts Alice's 0.1 ETH, sends 0.08 ETH to Bob, and 0.02 ETH remains locked in the contract.

```

       [Bob's Entity (Forger)]
             |  
       Listing: Fee = 0.1 ETH
             |
       Alice sends 0.1 ETH
             |
      ------------------------------
      |  Transaction Delayed       |
      ------------------------------
             |
      Bob reduces fee to 0.08 ETH
             |
       -----------------------------
       | Alice's Transaction       |
       | Executed After Delay      |
       -----------------------------
             |
       Contract Receives 0.1 ETH
             |
       -----------------------------
       |  Sends 0.08 ETH to Bob     |
       |  0.02 ETH Locked in Contract|
       -----------------------------
```

### Rationale for Severity

The severity is set to Medium because:

1. It can cause financial losses to users, but only in limited scenarios.
2. The impact is restricted to the difference between the original and reduced forging fee.
