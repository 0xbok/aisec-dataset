### Impact

All in-scope contracts of TraitForge inherit from the [Pausable contract of OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Pausable.sol), a feature designed to allow the pausing and unpausing of contract functionalities in emergency situations or for maintenance. However, (parent) contracts do not expose the `_pause()` and `_unpause()` functions and the Pausable contract contains only internal pausing/unpausing functions.

As a result, despite inheriting the pausability feature, administrators are unable to utilize these critical controls to pause or resume the contract's operations when needed, potentially leading to issues during periods requiring immediate intervention.

### Proof of Concept

Pause and unpause functions of the `Pausable` contract:

```solidity
    function _pause() internal virtual whenNotPaused {
        _paused = true;
        emit Paused(_msgSender());
    }

    function _unpause() internal virtual whenPaused {
        _paused = false;
        emit Unpaused(_msgSender());
    }
```

All in-scope contracts inherit `Pausable` but do not expose it. An example is [EntityTrading.sol](repos/2024-07-traitforge/contracts/EntityTrading/EntityTrading.sol), which explicitly tries to use the pausing functionality, as can be seen with the `whenNotPaused` modifier used in several functions.
