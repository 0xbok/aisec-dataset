## [M] `dettachFromManagedNFT` might revert and temporarily prevent users from detaching in certain situations

Users' veNFT might be temporarily undetachable, preventing users from performing action on their own veNFT.

### Proof-of-Concept

When users invoke `dettachFromManagedNFT` to get their veNFT back from `ManagedNFT`, `_poke` is called at the end of the function to update voting power across gauges voted by this `ManagedNFT`.

```solidity
function dettachFromManagedNFT(uint256 tokenId_) external nonReentrant onlyNftApprovedOrOwner(tokenId_) {
    _checkVoteDelay(tokenId_);
    _checkVoteWindow();
    IManagedNFTManager managedNFTManagerCache = IManagedNFTManager(managedNFTManager);
    uint256 managedTokenId = managedNFTManagerCache.getAttachedManagedTokenId(tokenId_);
    managedNFTManagerCache.onDettachFromManagedNFT(tokenId_);
    uint256 weight = IVotingEscrowV2(votingEscrow).balanceOfNftIgnoreOwnershipChange(managedTokenId);
    if (weight == 0) {
        _reset(managedTokenId);
        delete lastVotedTimestamps[managedTokenId];
    } else {
        _poke(managedTokenId);
    }
    emit DettachFromManagedNFT(tokenId_);
}

function _poke(uint256 tokenId_) internal {
    address[] memory _poolVote = poolVote[tokenId_];
    uint256[] memory _weights = new uint256[](_poolVote.length);

    for (uint256 i; i < _poolVote.length; ) {
        _weights[i] = votes[tokenId_][_poolVote[i]];
        unchecked {
            i++;
        }
    }
    _vote(tokenId_, _poolVote, _weights);
    _updateLastVotedTimestamp(tokenId_);
}

function _vote(uint256 tokenId_, address[] memory pools_, uint256[] memory weights_) internal {
    _reset(tokenId_);
    uint256 nftVotePower = IVotingEscrowV2(votingEscrow).balanceOfNFT(tokenId_);
    uint256 totalVotesWeight;
    uint256 totalVoterPower;
    for (uint256 i; i < pools_.length; i++) {
        GaugeState memory state = gaugesState[poolToGauge[pools_[i]]];
        if (!state.isAlive) {
            revert GaugeAlreadyKilled();
        }
        totalVotesWeight += weights_[i];
    }
    ...
    ... snipped ...
    ...
}
```

`_poke` loads a list of pools and weights voted by `ManagedNFT` then recast votes again to the same set of pools and weights via calling into `_vote`. However, `_vote` reverts when one of the pool/gauge has already been killed.

Now consider this situation:

1. Bob attaches his veNFT with `ManagedNFT`.
2. `ManagedNFT` votes for `[gaugeA, gaugeB]`.
3. `gaugeB` is killed.
4. Bob decides to detach his veNFT from `ManagedNFT`.
5. Bob's transaction reverts because `_poke` will attempt to recast the vote on `gaugeB`.
6. Bob can't detach his veNFT until `ManagedNFT` notices and recast the vote excluding `gaugeB`.

As a result, users' veNFT might be temporarily undetachable when the described scenario happens.
