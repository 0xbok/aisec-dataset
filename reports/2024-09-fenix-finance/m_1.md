## [M] `mVeNFT` DOS can't trigger the vote function

### Description

The `VoterUpgradeableV2.sol` contract has the function `attachToManagedNFT()`, users use it to delegate their `veFNX` voting power to a `mVeNFT`. One of the things this function does after receiving the new voting power is sub-call to `_poke()` and it will update the last voted timestamp of the `mVeNFT`.

[VoterUpgradeableV2.sol#L765](contracts/core/VoterUpgradeableV2.sol#L765):
```solidity
lastVotedTimestamps[tokenId_] = _epochTimestamp() + 1;
```

At this point, the `mVeNFT` can't trigger the vote function until the next epoch starts due to the `_checkVoteDelay()`. Even this check inside the `vote()` doesn't help in this case.

[VoterUpgradeableV2.sol#L491-L493](contracts/core/VoterUpgradeableV2.sol#L491-L493):
```solidity
if (!managedNFTManagerCache.isWhitelistedNFT(tokenId_)) {
            _checkEndVoteWindow();
        }
```

However, to make things worse this protocol is deployed on Blast transactions are too cheap
malicious users can keep creating new locks every epoch with one wei in `amount`  to bypass the zero check.

```solidity
File: VotingEscrowUpgradeableV2.sol#_createLock()

 LibVotingEscrowValidation.checkNoValueZero(amount_);
```

Then at the start of every new epoch (after the start of the voting window), just call `attachToManagedNFT()`. By doing this it keeps forcing the `mVeNFT` to vote to the same gauges.

### Impact

DOS attack where `mVeNFT` can't invoke the vote function to change the weight of gauges; `mVeNFT` can't reset its votes.
