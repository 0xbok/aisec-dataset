### Description

The `VoterUpgradeableV2.sol` contract has `killGauge()` that disables the gauge to prevent it from further rewards distribution, only the address with `GOVERNANCE_ROLE` role can call it.
the `killGauge()` only updates three state variables.

[VoterUpgradeableV2.sol#L227-L241](contracts/core/VoterUpgradeableV2.sol#L227-L241):
```solidity
227:     function killGauge(address gauge_) external onlyRole(_GOVERNANCE_ROLE) {
...
232:         delete gaugesState[gauge_].isAlive;
...
236:             delete gaugesState[gauge_].claimable;
...
240:         totalWeightsPerEpoch[epochTimestamp] -= weightsPerEpoch[epochTimestamp][state.pool];
```

The `distribute()` function will distribute rewards to pools managed by the `VoterUpgradeableV2.sol` contract and it will call the Minter contract by triggering `update_period()` function before distributing rewards.

The timeline looks like this:

```
        Epoch_x                      Epoch_x+1
        |-----------x-------------------|-x---------------------
           call `killGauge()`             call `distribute()`
```

When `distribute()` gets invoked in the timeline it will distribute the rewards of `Epoch_x`, The killed gauge has no weight in this epoch because its weight gets subtracted from `totalWeightsPerEpoch[]` in `killGauge()`.

When the Minter invokes `VoterUpgradeableV2.sol#notifyRewardAmount()` to notify the contract of the reward amount to be distributed for `Epoch_x`, we can also find in the same function how the `index` value gets increased.

[VoterUpgradeableV2.sol#L379-L389](contracts/core/VoterUpgradeableV2.sol#L379-L389):
```solidity
382:     function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 amount_) external {
...
387:         uint256 weightAt = totalWeightsPerEpoch[_epochTimestamp() - _WEEK];
388:         if (weightAt > 0) {
389:             index += (amount_ * 1e18) / weightAt;
390:         }
```

The `index` is updated as the reward amount divided by the total weights of `Epoch_x,`
we know the weight of the disabled gauge is not included in `totalWeightsPerEpoch[Epoch_x]`.

Back to [`_distribute()`](contracts/core/VoterUpgradeableV2.sol#L626-L651):
```solidity
671:     function _distribute(address gauge_) internal {
...
677:             uint256 totalVotesWeight = weightsPerEpoch[currentTimestamp - _WEEK][state.pool];
678:
679:             if (totalVotesWeight > 0) {
...
684:                     if (state.isAlive) {
685:                         gaugesState[gauge_].claimable += amount;
686:                     } else {
687:                         IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(minter, amount);
}
```

Because `killGauge()` doesn't delete the values of `weightsPerEpoch[]`, it will send back `amount` of emissions back to Minter, which actually should get distributed between the existing pools.

To summarize, the `index` is directly related by the value of `totalWeightsPerEpoch[Epoch_x]`, and the `killGauge()` is subtracted from the `weightsPerEpoch` of the disabled gauge. Therefore, the `index` didn't include the weight of the killed gauge, but `_distribute` calculates its emission and sends it back to Minter.

To understand the impact, in case the total emissions for `Epoch_x` is `80e18` with three active gauges (with the same amount of votes), each pool will receive `26.5e18` tokens.

But in case one gauge gets killed, one scenario is the 1st gauge will receive `40e18` and the other `40e18` will get transferred back to Minter. This will leave the last gauge with 0 emissions (from here, the impact is related to how `gauge.sol#.notifyRewardAmount()` will handle this situation which is out of scope in this audit).

Another scenario is to send `40e18` to the two gauges but the disabled gauge gets revived in the next epoch and will be able to receive his `40e18` tokens because the `gaugesState[gauge_].index` is not updated (this will loop us to the above scenario again because the `40e18` tokens do not exist in the first time).

### Impact

- One or more gauges will not receive their emissions.
- Wrong calculation of `gaugesState[gauge_].claimable`.
- The distribution system will be broken if the killed gauge gets revived again.

The impact depends on the order of the gauges array that passed to `distribute()` function.

### Proof of Concept

Let's say now is `Epoch_x` +1:

- We have three pools with the same vote weight (500e18) for each of them.
- `index = 10e18`.
- Total emission is: `amount_ = 80e18`.
- The `totalWeightsPerEpoch` of `Epoch_x` is: `weightAt = 1500e18`.

**Scenario 1:**

No gauge gets disabled and each gauge will receive `26.5e18` tokens as emission.

This is how we calculate it:

```
    How `notifyRewardAmount()` increase the `index`
    uint256 weightAt = 1500e18
    uint256 amount_ = 80e18

    index += (amount_ * 1e18) / weightAt;
                = (80e18 * 1e18)/1500e18
                = 5.3e16
    Now, index = 10.053e18

     How `distribute()` calcul the `amount` for the 3 pools
    uint256 delta = index - state.index;
                            =  10.053 e18- 10e18
                            = 0.053e18

    uint256 amount = (totalVotesWeight * delta) / 1e18;
                                = (500e18 * 0.053e18)/1e18
                                = 26.5e18
```

**Scenario 2:**

One gauge gets disabled, so the `totalWeightsPerEpoch` of `Epoch_x` is now `weightAt = 1000e18`.
With the current logic, two gauges each will receive `40e18` tokens as emission and `40e18` should be sent back to Minter; which is larger than the total emission which is `80e18`.

This is how we calculate it:

```
    How `notifyRewardAmount()` increase the `index`
    uint256 weightAt = 1000e18
    uint256 amount_ = 80e18

    index += (amount_ * 1e18) / weightAt;
                = (80e18 * 1e18)/1000e18
                = 8e16
    Now, index = 10.08e18

     How `distribute()` calcul the `amount` for the 3 pools
    uint256 delta = index - state.index;
                            =  10.08 e18- 10e18
                            = 0.08e18

    uint256 amount = (totalVotesWeight * delta) / 1e18;
                                = (500e18 * 0.08e18)/1e18
                                = 40e18
```
