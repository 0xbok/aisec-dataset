## [M] Contract `PhiNFT1155` can't be paused

The pausing mechanism of `PhiNFT1155` contract is implemented incorrectly and doesn't work. Users are still able to transfer NFTs in paused state.

### Summary

Contract `PhiNFT1155` inherits from the [following parent contracts](src/art/PhiNFT1155.sol#L21-L31):

[PhiNFT1155.sol#L21-L31](src/art/PhiNFT1155.sol#L21-L31):
```solidity
contract PhiNFT1155 is
    Initializable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    ERC1155SupplyUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    Ownable2StepUpgradeable,
    IPhiNFT1155,
    Claimable,
    CreatorRoyaltiesControl
{
```

The problem with the above is that inheriting from `PausableUpgradeable` is not effective in the scope of OZ `ERC1155` contracts. As a result, users are able to transfer NFT tokens even when the contract is paused, as the below PoC demonstrates.
