## [M] Cred creator could cause stuck funds

Update of cred can be triggered by the cred creator. If there are already issued shares for users, and the cred creator decides to update the `sellShareRoyalty_` this will lead users to pay up to 50% fee depending on the value. And users will be in situation that to withdraw their funds, they need to pay 50% to the cred creator and additionally some fee to the protocol.

### Proof of Concept

We have the following situation:

1. 500 issued shares and the current sell fee is 0.05%.
2. And the cred creator decides to increase the fee to 50%.
3. If any of the users wants to withdraw funds, they need to pay 50% to the creator and also protocol fee.

For example, let's imagine that the current number of shares issued is 500 of max 999 and one of the users is owner of 5 shares. If we add this test to `Cred.t.sol`:

```solidity
function test_value() public {
        uint256 x = bondingCurve.getSellPrice(500, 5);
        assertEq(153_019_801_980_198_020, x);
    }
```

We will see that the sell price is around `1.53e17` which in the current price is equal to `$420`, this means that the 50% or `$210` will be paid to the cred creator as fee, which will lead to significant lose of funds for share holders. If the number of shares that are issued the lose is growing.
