## [H] Reentrancy in creating Creds allows an attacker to steal all Ether from the Cred contract

### Vulnerability Details

During cred creation, the sender automatically buys 1 share of the cred. During share purchases, a refund is issued if Ether provided by the sender exceeds the value needed. It allows an attacker to reenter both cred creation and share trading functions. Which, in turn, allows the attacker to overwrite cred data before the `credIdCounter` is incremented. This fact introduces a critical vulnerability in the case when there is more than one whitelisted bonding curve. The attacker can purchase shares cheaply, overwrite the cred, and sell the shares expensively, almost depleting the entire contract balance.

Let's discuss a possible attack vector in detail.

Preparations. The attacker prepares two sets of cred creation data which may be quite legit. The most important aspect is that the first set uses a "cheaper" bonding curve and the other uses a more expensive one (see the Impact section for more details). The sender's address would be a helper contract address. However, the attacker doesn't need to deploy the contract beforehand to know its address, since there are several ways to know a to-be-deployed contract address without exposing its bytecode (e.g. by deployer address and nonce or with the help of the `CREATE2` opcode). To sum up, at the moment of checking cred creation data and signing there are no signs of malignancy.

Then, the attacker deploys the helper contract and invokes an attack. Further actions are executed by the contract in a single transaction as follows.

1. The attacker creates the first cred, with the cheap `IBondingCurve` used. The cred creation code invokes `buyShareCred(credIdCounter, 1, 0);` as part of its job. The attacker provides excess Ether, so a refund is triggered and the control goes back to the attacker. Note that [the counter increment](relative_path_091409:src/Cred.sol#L574) is not reached yet.

    ```solidity
        function _createCredInternal(
            address creator_,
            string memory credURL_,
            string memory credType_,
            string memory verificationType_,
            address bondingCurve_,
            uint16 buyShareRoyalty_,
            uint16 sellShareRoyalty_
        )
            internal
            whenNotPaused
            returns (uint256)
        {
            if (creator_ == address(0)) {
                revert InvalidAddressZero();
            }

            creds[credIdCounter].creator = creator_;
            creds[credIdCounter].credURL = credURL_;
            creds[credIdCounter].credType = credType_;
            creds[credIdCounter].verificationType = verificationType_;
            creds[credIdCounter].bondingCurve = bondingCurve_;
            creds[credIdCounter].createdAt = uint40(block.timestamp);
            creds[credIdCounter].buyShareRoyalty = buyShareRoyalty_;
            creds[credIdCounter].sellShareRoyalty = sellShareRoyalty_;

            buyShareCred(credIdCounter, 1, 0);

            emit CredCreated(creator_, credIdCounter, credURL_, credType_, verificationType_);

            credIdCounter += 1;

            return credIdCounter - 1;
        }
    ```

2. The attacker buys some amount of shares of the almost created cred by invoking [buyShareCred](relative_path_091409:src/Cred.sol#L178). Note that there are no significant obstacles to doing that as the attacker can employ a flash loan. Again, the attacker provides excess Ether, so a refund is triggered and the control goes back to the attacker.

3. Remember that the control is still nested in `buyShareCred` nested in the first `createCred`. This time the attacker invokes the [createCred](relative_path_091409:src/Cred.sol#L232-L241) again, with the second cred creation data, with a more expensive bonding curve used. Note that there are no reentrancy guards in `createCred`, `buyShareCred`, or `sellShareCred`. The data is passed to [_createCredInternal](relative_path_091409:src/Cred.sol#L557-L570) where it overwrites the first cred contents in the `creds[credIdCounter]` (remember, the counter is not incremented yet by the first `createCred`). [Here is](relative_path_091409:src/Cred.sol#L565) the most important part of the overwriting for the attacker: they just changed the bonding curve.

    ```solidity
        creds[credIdCounter].bondingCurve = bondingCurve_;
    ```

A couple of lines below `buyShareCred` will be hit again and the attacker grabs back the control in the usual manner.

4. Now the attacker calls `sellShareCred` and dumps as many purchased shares as possible until depleting the Cred balance or his own share balance. The "more expensive" bonding curve gives the attacker more Ether than they spend while buying on step 2. Note that the share lock time also won't help as the timestamp [is not yet set](relative_path_091409:src/Cred.sol#L644), which is the subject of another finding.

    ```solidity
        if (isBuy) {
            cred.currentSupply += amount_;
            uint256 excessPayment = msg.value - price - protocolFee - creatorFee;
            if (excessPayment > 0) {
                _msgSender().safeTransferETH(excessPayment);
            }
            lastTradeTimestamp[credId_][curator_] = block.timestamp;
        } else {
            cred.currentSupply -= amount_;
            curator_.safeTransferETH(price - protocolFee - creatorFee);
        }
    ```

Even if the `SHARE_LOCK_PERIOD` was honored, that would mean that the attacker has to wait 10 minutes before pocketing the profit. That would make the situation a bit more difficult for the attacker, but still highly dangerous for the protocol.

5. At this moment almost all Ether from the Cred contract is transferred to the attacker's contract. The attacker has to keep some of the Ether intact since now the unwinding of the nested calls is happening (and some fees are paid): the second `createCred`, `buyShareCred`, and the first `createCred`.

### Impact

As soon as there is more than one bonding curve whitelisted in the protocol, the vulnerability allows to drain almost entire protocol funds. Whitelisting more than one curve [seems to be an expected behavior](relative_path_091409:src/Cred.sol#L159-L166).

Fine-tuning the numbers to exploit the bonding curve price differences is a mere technicality, e.g. if there was just a 10% price difference that would be more than enough to perform an attack. Also note that on the current codebase, the attack may be repeated numerously and instantly.

### Proof of Concept

Please apply the patch to the `test/Cred.t.sol` and run with `forge test --match-test testCredDraining -vv`.
