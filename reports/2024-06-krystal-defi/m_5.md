## [M] Swapping logic would be broken for some supported tokens

First take a look at this excerpt from the README: 

<relative_path_091409:README.md#L103-L106>

```

From the above we can conclude that tokens like BNB that revert on zero value approvals are to be integrated within protocol.

Now take a look at <relative_path_091409:src/Common.sol#L537-L567>

```solidity
    function _swap(IERC20 tokenIn, IERC20 tokenOut, uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOutMin, bytes memory swapData) internal returns (uint256 amountInDelta, uint256 amountOutDelta) {
        if (amountIn != 0 && swapData.length != 0 && address(tokenOut) != address(0)) {
            uint256 balanceInBefore = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
            uint256 balanceOutBefore = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

            // approve needed amount
            _safeApprove(tokenIn, swapRouter, amountIn);
            // execute swap
            (bool success,) = swapRouter.call(swapData);
            if (!success) {
                revert ("swap failed!");
            }

            // reset approval
            //@audit resetting the approval would never work for these tokens
            _safeApprove(tokenIn, swapRouter, 0);

            uint256 balanceInAfter = tokenIn.balanceOf(address(this));
            uint256 balanceOutAfter = tokenOut.balanceOf(address(this));

            amountInDelta = balanceInBefore - balanceInAfter;
            amountOutDelta = balanceOutAfter - balanceOutBefore;

            // amountMin slippage check
            if (amountOutDelta < amountOutMin) {
                revert SlippageError();
            }

            // event for any swap with exact swapped value
            emit Swap(address(tokenIn), address(tokenOut), amountInDelta, amountOutDelta);
        }
    }
```

This is the general swap function that eventually gets called which uses the external router with off-chain calculated swap instruction. The issue, however, is that after approving the initial amount needed to the router, there is a need to reset these approvals, however resetting these approvals whereas would work for most tokens would not work for a token like BNB that's to be supported, [see minimalistic coded POC here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20/blob/main/src/ApprovalWithZeroValue.sol), which then translates to a direct break in swapping for these tokens and other instances where `_swap()` gets called across protocol.

Additionally, it seems the `_safeResetAndApprove()` function was coded to help sort this issue, but it is not being used in `_swap()`, <relative_path_091409:src/Common.sol#L713-L724>

```solidity
    /// @dev some tokens require allowance == 0 to approve new amount
    /// but some tokens does not allow approve ammount = 0
    /// we try to set allowance = 0 before approve new amount. if it revert means that
    /// the token not allow to approve 0, which means the following line code will work properly
    function _safeResetAndApprove(IERC20 token, address _spender, uint256 _value) internal {
        /// @dev ommited approve(0) result because it might fail and does not break the flow
        address(token).call(abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, _spender, 0));

        /// @dev value for approval after reset must greater than 0
        require(_value > 0);
        _safeApprove(token, _spender, _value);
    }
```

### Impact

As hinted above, swaps would be completely broken for tokens that revert on zero value approvals, due to a reversion that always occurs on this [line](relative_path_091409:src/Common.sol#L551-L552).
