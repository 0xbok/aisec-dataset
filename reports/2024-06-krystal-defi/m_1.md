## [M] Wrong logic in `AUTO_COMPOUND` doesn't allow for swap to token1

Protocol functionality broken

### Proof of Concept

`AUTO_COMPOUND` action allows for compounding your gains into liquidity. It additionally allows for swaps in the middle. There is a faulty condition though, which is never effective and does not allow to set `token1` as targetToken, namely `else if (state.token0 == state.token1)` in [V3Automation.sol#L154-L156](repos/2024-06-krystal-defi/src/V3Automation.sol#L154-L156):

```solidity
        } else if (params.action == Action.AUTO_COMPOUND) {
            if (params.targetToken == state.token0) {
                _swapAndIncrease(
//[...]

            // @audit it should be params.targetToken == state.token1 Currently it doesn't allow for a swap
@>          } else if (state.token0 == state.token1) {  // Line 154
                _swapAndIncrease(
//[...]

            } else {
                // compound without swap
                _swapAndIncrease(
//[...]
            }
```

Because pools cannot have the same token0 and token1, there is no possible position that will fulfill this condition. Looking at other parts of the codebase and params passed to `_swapAndIncrease()` in this code branch, what the protocol wants to achieve is to check if `params.targetToken == state.token1` and perform swap similarly to `params.targetToken == state.token0` branch.
