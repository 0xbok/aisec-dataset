## [M] Size uses wrong source to query available liquidity on Aave, resulting in borrow and lend operations being bricked upon mainnet deployment

Size queries the `underlyingBorrowToken` balance of the `variablePool` during borrowing and lending actions in order to check available liquidity. If there is not enough available liquidity for the new borrower to withdraw the borrowed assets, the function call will revert:

[Size::buyCreditMarket](relative_path_091409:src/Size.sol#L178-L185)

```solidity
178:    function buyCreditMarket(BuyCreditMarketParams calldata params) external payable override(ISize) whenNotPaused {
...
184:        state.validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity(amount); // @audit: liquidity check
```

[Size::sellCreditMarket](relative_path_091409:src/Size.sol#L188-L194)

```solidity
188:    function sellCreditMarket(SellCreditMarketParams memory params) external payable override(ISize) whenNotPaused {
...
194:        state.validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity(amount); // @audit: liquidity check
```

[CapsLibrary::validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity](relative_path_091409:src/libraries/CapsLibrary.sol#L67-L71)

```solidity
67:    function validateVariablePoolHasEnoughLiquidity(State storage state, uint256 amount) public view {
68:        uint256 liquidity = state.data.underlyingBorrowToken.balanceOf(address(state.data.variablePool)); // @audit: ATokens hold liquidity, not variablePool
69:        if (liquidity < amount) {
70:            revert Errors.NOT_ENOUGH_BORROW_ATOKEN_LIQUIDITY(liquidity, amount);
71:        }
```

However, [Aave actual holds all liquidity in the `AToken` contracts](https://app.aave.com/markets/), not the `Pool` contracts. Therefore, the liquidity check above will always fail when the `variablePool` references a live instance of an actual Aave Pool. This is due to the fact that the `variablePool` balance will be 0 (does not hold any liquidity), causing borrowing and lending actions to revert on line 70 in `CapsLibrary.sol`.

The below code snippets are taken from out of scope contracts, but are shown to further explain why the test suite did not detect this vulnerability:

[SupplyLogic::executeSupply](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/6070e82d962d9b12835c88e68210d0e63f08d035/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/SupplyLogic.sol#L52-L67)

```solidity
52:  function executeSupply(
...
67:    IERC20(params.asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, reserveCache.aTokenAddress, params.amount);
```

As shown above, the actual implementation of the Aave pool will transfer supplied assets to the `aTokenAddress` on supplies. The Aave pool implementation will then transfer the assets from the AToken to the recipient during withdraws, since the liquidity is stored in the AToken contract:

[SupplyLogic::executeWithdraw](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/6070e82d962d9b12835c88e68210d0e63f08d035/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/SupplyLogic.sol#L106-L144)

```solidity
106:  function executeWithdraw(
...
139:    IAToken(reserveCache.aTokenAddress).burn(
140:      msg.sender,
141:      params.to,
142:      amountToWithdraw,
143:      reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex
144:    );
```

[AToken::burn](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/6070e82d962d9b12835c88e68210d0e63f08d035/contracts/protocol/tokenization/AToken.sol#L96-L104)

```solidity
96:   function burn(
97:     address from,
98:     address receiverOfUnderlying,
99:     uint256 amount,
100:    uint256 index
101:  ) external virtual override onlyPool {
102:    _burnScaled(from, receiverOfUnderlying, amount, index);
103:    if (receiverOfUnderlying != address(this)) {
104:      IERC20(_underlyingAsset).safeTransfer(receiverOfUnderlying, amount);
```

However, Size uses a `PoolMock` contract for their test suite, which implements logic that differs from actual Aave Pool contracts:

[PoolMock.sol#L67-L78](relative_path_091409:test/mocks/PoolMock.sol#L67-L78)

```solidity
67:    function supply(address asset, uint256 amount, address onBehalfOf, uint16) external {
68:        Data memory data = datas[asset];
69:        IERC20Metadata(asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount); // @audit: underlying transferred from supplier to PoolMock contract
70:        data.aToken.mint(address(this), onBehalfOf, amount, data.reserveIndex);
71:    }
72:
73:    function withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount, address to) external returns (uint256) {
74:        Data memory data = datas[asset];
75:        data.aToken.burn(msg.sender, address(data.aToken), amount, data.reserveIndex); // @audit: no assets transferred from AToken
76:        IERC20Metadata(asset).safeTransfer(to, amount); // @audit: underlying transferred from PoolMock contract to supplier
77:        return amount;
78:    }
```

As shown above, the `PoolMock` contract transfers all supplied assets to the `PoolMock` contract itself, not the AToken contract. This differs from how actual Aave Pools handle liquidity on live networks.

### Impact

Borrow (`sellCreditMarket`) and lend (`buyCreditMarket`) operations will be bricked when Size is deployed and integrates with Aave on a live network. This report is labeled as High due to the fact that the main functionalities of this lending protocol will be unusable upon deployment.

### Proof of Concept

The following PoC simply showcases the fact that the `AToken` does not hold the liquidity in the test suite. See [here](https://app.aave.com/markets/) to observe that `ATokens` are the contracts that hold liquidity for Aave in live networks.
