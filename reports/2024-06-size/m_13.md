## [M] Fragmentation fee is not taken if user compensates with newly created position

### Impact

User can split his debt credit using the `compensate` function without paying the fragmentation fee.

### Proof of Concept

The fragmentation fee normally applies when the initial credit amount is split, creating a new credit position with the fractionalized amount. However, under specific conditions when the `compensate` function is invoked, this fee is not charged.

Consider the following scenario, the user compensates half of his debt (`amountToCompensate = creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.credit / 2`) with a new credit position (`params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID`) to the lender:

```solidity
    function executeCompensate(State storage state, CompensateParams calldata params) external {
        emit Events.Compensate(
            params.creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId, params.creditPositionToCompensateId, params.amount
        );

        CreditPosition storage creditPositionWithDebtToRepay =
            state.getCreditPosition(params.creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId);
        DebtPosition storage debtPositionToRepay =
            state.getDebtPositionByCreditPositionId(params.creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId);

>>      uint256 amountToCompensate = Math.min(params.amount, creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.credit);

        CreditPosition memory creditPositionToCompensate;
        if (params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID) {
>>          creditPositionToCompensate = state.createDebtAndCreditPositions({
                lender: msg.sender,
                borrower: msg.sender,
                futureValue: amountToCompensate,
                dueDate: debtPositionToRepay.dueDate
            });

        ---SNIP---
```

In the above code snippet, a new credit position is created with `credit = futureValue = amountToCompensate`. This results in `creditPositionToCompensate.credit` always equating to `amountToCompensate`, leading `exiterCreditRemaining` to consistently be zero:

```solidity
        ---SNIP---

>>      uint256 exiterCreditRemaining = creditPositionToCompensate.credit - amountToCompensate;

        // credit emission
        state.createCreditPosition({
            exitCreditPositionId: params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID
                ? state.data.nextCreditPositionId - 1
                : params.creditPositionToCompensateId,
            lender: creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.lender,
            credit: amountToCompensate
        });
>>      if (exiterCreditRemaining > 0) {
            // charge the fragmentation fee in collateral tokens, capped by the user balance
            uint256 fragmentationFeeInCollateral = Math.min(
                state.debtTokenAmountToCollateralTokenAmount(state.feeConfig.fragmentationFee),
                state.data.collateralToken.balanceOf(msg.sender)
            );
            state.data.collateralToken.transferFrom(
                msg.sender, state.feeConfig.feeRecipient, fragmentationFeeInCollateral
            );
```

As a result, despite splitting `creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.credit` in half and creating a new credit position, the fragmentation fee is not deducted as expected.
