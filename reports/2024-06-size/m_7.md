## [M] Credit can be sold forcibly as `forSale` setting can be ignored via Compensate

Any credit position can be forcibly sold with the help of its borrower. This will be executed only when have expected profit; for example, when lender's curve is not null and is above the market it is profitable to buy credit from them (lend to them at above market rates), but they might block it with the lack of free collateral and the `forSale = false` flag, which can be overridden by the corresponding borrower of this credit position. The impact of this forced sale is proportional to interest rate volatility and can be substantial. There are no additional prerequisites for the setup.

### Proof of Concept

`createDebtAndCreditPositions` creates credit positions with `forSale == true`:

[AccountingLibrary.sol#L62-L82](relative_path_091409:src/libraries/AccountingLibrary.sol#L62-L82)

```solidity
    function createDebtAndCreditPositions(
        ...
    ) external returns (CreditPosition memory creditPosition) {
        DebtPosition memory debtPosition =
            DebtPosition({borrower: borrower, futureValue: futureValue, dueDate: dueDate, liquidityIndexAtRepayment: 0});

        uint256 debtPositionId = state.data.nextDebtPositionId++;
        state.data.debtPositions[debtPositionId] = debtPosition;

        emit Events.CreateDebtPosition(debtPositionId, borrower, lender, futureValue, dueDate);

        creditPosition = CreditPosition({
            lender: lender,
            credit: debtPosition.futureValue,
            debtPositionId: debtPositionId,
>>          forSale: true
        });
```

This can be done on demand for any credit position by the borrower of the corresponding debt position, by running Compensate with `params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID`, which will create new position with `forSale == true` and substitute the existing lender position with it:

[Compensate.sol#L118-L145](relative_path_091409:src/libraries/actions/Compensate.sol#L118-L145)

```solidity
        CreditPosition memory creditPositionToCompensate;
        if (params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID) {
>>          creditPositionToCompensate = state.createDebtAndCreditPositions({  // @audit create new credit with `forSale == true`
                lender: msg.sender,
                borrower: msg.sender,
                futureValue: amountToCompensate,
                dueDate: debtPositionToRepay.dueDate
            });
        } else {
            creditPositionToCompensate = state.getCreditPosition(params.creditPositionToCompensateId);
            amountToCompensate = Math.min(amountToCompensate, creditPositionToCompensate.credit);
        }

        // debt and credit reduction
        state.reduceDebtAndCredit(
            creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.debtPositionId, params.creditPositionWithDebtToRepayId, amountToCompensate
        );

        uint256 exiterCreditRemaining = creditPositionToCompensate.credit - amountToCompensate;

        // credit emission
>>      state.createCreditPosition({
            exitCreditPositionId: params.creditPositionToCompensateId == RESERVED_ID  // @audit give it to the lender instead of the existing position with `forSale == false`
                ? state.data.nextCreditPositionId - 1
                : params.creditPositionToCompensateId,
            lender: creditPositionWithDebtToRepay.lender,
            credit: amountToCompensate
        });
```

Then, it can be then bought with `BuyCreditMarket`:

[BuyCreditMarket.sol#L79-L8](relative_path_091409:src/libraries/actions/BuyCreditMarket.sol#L79-L83)

```solidity
            borrower = creditPosition.lender;
            tenor = debtPosition.dueDate - block.timestamp; // positive since the credit position is transferrable, so the loan must be ACTIVE
        }

        BorrowOffer memory borrowOffer = state.data.users[borrower].borrowOffer;
```
