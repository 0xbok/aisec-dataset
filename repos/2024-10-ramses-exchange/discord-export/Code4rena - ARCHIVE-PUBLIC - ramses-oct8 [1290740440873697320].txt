**Rolling Triage**

As a reminder, this audit includes [Rolling Triage](https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810929015509483554/1291193790421532743).  Submissions are now open and will close on 10/11/2024 20:00. Please submit HMs only during this period.

@üê∫Wardens For the upcoming Ramses audit, we are holding a Twitter thread competition. If this goes well, we may do more of them.

**$1,000 in awards will be distributed as follows:**

1. 40% of pool for best twitter thread
2. 20% of pool for 2nd best twitter thread
3. 10% of pool for 3rd best twitter thread
4. 20% Twitter thread with the greatest reach/engagement
5. 10% Quote tweet with the greatest reach/engagement

**To be eligible:**
- The thread should focus on adding value in some way‚Äîideally the thread is about technical detail or features or educational 
- No shilling
- Post your thread between now and Oct 22nd at 20:00 UTC, 1 week before the competition ends
- Drop the url of your thread in the #ramses-oct8 competition channel and tag @üß∫ picnic 

**Rules:**
- to prevent drive-by LLMs, only SRs are eligible
- staff will retweet any deemed eligible for ‚Äòbest‚Äô (though the timing of these retweets will be staggered, so don't be surprised)
- genuine, organic engagement is what counts (staff will make our best effort to assess this reasonably and fairly‚Äîno pure metrics because these can be gamed with bot accounts and if we ban submitters for bots, then bots can be weaponized against other competitors)

@WillyCode20 @Parisbro to confirm, are you still unable to submit?


[10/09/2024 09:45] cloudellie
We did see some errors with users submitting findings with titles that exceeded Github's allowable character limit, so we've added validation for that to the submission form. Not seeing any other errors on our side.


[10/09/2024 09:51] cloudellie
You may need to refresh for that validation to work

Hey everyone, dropping in to give some answers to some FAQs to help provide more clarity:

**Q: What are some differences between UniV3 and RamsesV3?**
A1: UniswapV3 is =0.7.6, with no production-ready ^0.8 compatible release. We had to adapt all the math and accounting that relies on under/overflows to have proper `unchecked` blocks and flip signs where needed.
A2: Ramses has a ve-governance system, also known as a MetaDEX or "Solidly" model. As such, we reward liquidity providers via our GaugeV3s, based on accounting in the libraries, which communicate with the V3Pool to allow a **non-custodial CL rewarding system.** Our Gauges are the first hardened 
A3: The aforementioned rewarding system relies mainly on the following contracts-- (GaugeV3, Position, Tick, Oracle, RamsesV3Pool). The reward accounting uses a debt system which is updated upon necessary interactions.
A4: Users can claim gauge rewards (emissions or any whitelisted LP incentives), on a per-second basis -- accruing in real-time while in range.
A5: `feeProtocol` moved away from the bitshifting and does a linear (0-100) system for feeSplits. e.g. 10 feeProtocol = 10% of swap fees go to the FeeCollector, and 90% goes to liquidity providers. This is normally 80% to the FeeCollector by default.
A6: In UniswapV3, pools are mapped by their feeTiers to tickSpacing. In RamsesV3 we map pools by their tickspacing explicitly, mitigating duplicate tickspacing pools with different initial fee tiers
A7: UniswapV3 pools do not have dynamic (Adjustable) swap fees while Ramses' do. 

**Q: UniswapV3 is already battle-tested / hardened, why does it need to be audited redundantly?**
A: While UniswapV3 is infact very secure, we rewrote for ^0.8 and compile in viaIr; which has a lot of nuances regarding the math/accounting.

**Q: What is a period? Why does this matter?**
A: A period is a colloquial way to refer to an epoch. Periods align with the timestamps of the start of the epoch. [0 UTC Thursday -> 23:59 UTC Wednesday]
A2: GaugeV3 rewards are distributed per period, and can be retroactive/future-earned depending on the period notified and current time within the epoch.

Happy to answer any other questions as they come as well ü´°  happy hunting.

[10/09/2024 20:43] noro9954
does the gauge system reward LPs or just voters ?


[10/09/2024 20:43] keccakdog
Gauges are essentially the multirewarders for CL positions, emissions and any LP Incentives would go through there.


[10/09/2024 20:44] keccakdog
emissions are allocated based on voting weight from prior to epoch flip


[10/09/2024 20:44] keccakdog
voters earn the majority of swap fees, and 100% of voting incentives -- through individual feeDistributors per gauge(pool)


[10/09/2024 20:48] noro9954
who profits from RAM emissions ?


[10/09/2024 20:51] 0xsorrynotsorry

[10/09/2024 21:40] keccakdog
LPers get emissions, and a % of swap fees (default is 20%); the rest goes to feeCollection and Voters (veRAM holders) benefit from claiming these fees and any external incentives.

@DOG | Ramses, can you please confirm that the contracts in scope in the contest rules are correct? Are you planning to audit contracts like the Voter and such later on?


[10/10/2024 06:00] keccakdog
scope is correct, the focus is around our V3 pools and Gauges. Voter and the rest have been audited a couple months ago, but do not hold user funds so are less of a priority.

[10/12/2024 04:43] benrai
@Jay | C4 Since the first phase for this contest is over and we have access to all submitted findings:I was wondering,  do we need to go through all findings in the validation repo to ensure that we know all known issues or will only the issues in the findings repo be known issues once the triage is over?


[10/12/2024 06:40] enami_el
Do you have access to all submitted findings?


[10/12/2024 07:25] benrai
Yes, but I also submitted a finding. The links where shared here https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1166686843421593631/1294403791067676789


[10/12/2024 07:30] sockdrawermoney
There will be a collection of ‚Äúknown issues‚Äù triaged by the validator which are likely to be more broad than what will end up accepted for awards in judging. So don‚Äôt take the issues as having been fully judged, just triaged


[10/12/2024 07:33] benrai
Ok, so no need to go through all submissions, we can wait for the list of "known issues" at the end of the triage phase. Will the list be separately published or will the known issues be the once that are in the findings repo after the triage?

This section also includes some additional notes from the sponsor re: code forked from Uniswap.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you submitted an issue in phase 1 and *do not have the SR role*, **you must have a verified Github account associated with your C4 warden account to access the known issues repo.**

What about wardens are not SR and didn't submit any findings in phase 1?


[10/15/2024 20:24] itsmetechjay
Wardens who are not SR or didn't submit findings during phase 1 will not have access to the Known Issues repo.


[10/15/2024 20:24] hero0130
I will say that feels like it puts non SR wardens joining late at a disadvantage.


[10/15/2024 20:29] hero0130
on top of that it prevents wardens who join late from focusing on finding new bugs (what the client likely wants) and instead finding older easier to find bugs.


[10/15/2024 20:31] hero0130
but if ramses's code is in production i could see why you wouldnt want to make unpatched vulns public.

@üê∫Wardens  There was a glitch last night where a small number of submissions (8 in total) from the current submission phase were unexpectedly copied to the validation and findings repos -- thereby making them visible to wardens with repo access. 

Since this carries the unfortunate risk that other wardens may have seen the issues and duplicated them, we have added these 8 submissions to the known issues repo and they will be considered out of scope for the rest of the audit.

I apologize to all participants, as I realize it's disruptive to have a new batch of known issues part-way through the submission period. However, after discussing it internally we felt it was the fairest path forward, to avoid the risk of the affected wardens' work being copied. 

We have taken steps to address the underlying issue so this won't happen again. Again, my sincerest apologies.

~~*Note: the known issues repo will be temporarily unavailable while we add the new issues; I'll update this post when it's available again.*~~

*Update: the known issues repo has been updated and access has been restored to SR wardens and wardens who submitted during the first week.*

Does wardens who participated on this audit still have the right to access to backstage? Without sr role?


[10/29/2024 23:48] mrpotatomagic
Mostly not, the finalized findings can now only be viewed by non-SR after the report is published. Previous access to phase 1 & 2 findings was mainly provided to avoid submitting duplicates of the known issues.

Quick question @ü¶ô liveactionllama | C4 , will the distribution be this week??


[11/19/2024 11:51] daniel526
funds when?


[11/19/2024 20:25] liveactionllamac4
@proxyma | Paladin & @Daniel526 - I believe awards for the Twitter thread competition will follow the normal timing (i.e. first batch of awards distributed within ~1 week of the award announcement, if you've [completed your tax info](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards/awarding-process#tax-information-for-code4rena-contributors-wardens-judges-etc)). I'll double-check with our payments team though. **Edit:** confirmed it should follow the normal timing.
