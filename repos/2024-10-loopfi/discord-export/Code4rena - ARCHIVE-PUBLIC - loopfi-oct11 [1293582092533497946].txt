ℹ️ Please note: This is an update audit on the same codebase that C4 audited back in July-August: https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-loopfi. Given the scope of the mitigations, we recommended they run a follow-up audit.

The primary focus should be the diff between that audit and this one. A provisional audit report for the preceding competition will be shared alongside the updated code, to clarify all issues uncovered during the July-Aug audit.

Want to confirm: Are the findings in the 2024-07 contest are all automatically out of scope? For example, an issue was valid for that contest, but the protocol team chooses to not fix it.

Also, for an unfixed previous finding, how do we know it was unfixed on purpose or not?

Br, the pool for us let us breathe.

Here’s a question you can post in Discord to clarify what the GA-14 and similar notations mean in the code:

Hi everyone,

I’ve come across some notations in the code, such as U:[GA-14], U:[GA-15], etc., and I’m wondering what they refer to. Are these references to previous audit findings, or do they serve another purpose? I want to make sure I’m not duplicating efforts by reviewing these same sections if they’ve already been addressed.

Thanks in advance for any clarification!

Some parts are forked from Gearbox and those are identifiers Gearbox used for their fix / audit


[10/16/2024 21:11] ferdaozdemir8857
Ok, thanks

@kartoonjoy | C4🎇🎇 Can you help confirm this? Whether for this audit we should submit the unfixed issues for the one in 2024-07.

@pkqs90 Any findings from the preceding audit should be considered out of scope, **except**  `sponsor confirmed` findings that were later mitigated (this should be indicated in the code), but where the fix is insufficient or introduced a new issue. 

If the LoopFi team considered it a `wontfix` (i.e. `sponsor acknowledged` or `sponsor disputed`) in the preceding audit, and did not patch it, resubmitting it to this audit would a) have no value to the sponsor and b) most likely provide no value to wardens, since those issues are all known and could be submitted 100x. 😅

**🚨 AUDIT ALERT**

@🐺Wardens The **LoopFi** audit is now closed! Huge thanks to everyone who participated 🔍, whether you submitted a finding or not.

What's next: The sponsor team and judge will review the findings over the next couple of weeks.

Good code to read. Interesting learnings. I spent the whole week on LoopFi alone. Best wishes.

Curious here,  can anyone help clarify how update contests get finalised on C4... considering the judging of the the July https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/1235706013252849767 contest has been stalled/delayed, does that mean this would also take some time due to backlog before being finalised? _longer than usual?_


[10/23/2024 09:57] cloudellie
No, they are treated as separate competitions. So the timeline of the preceding audit should not have any direct impact on the timeline for the update audit.

congrats to all

how long does it take for the finding to reflect on the profile ?


[11/25/2024 15:16] thebrittfactor
Valid findings are already be reflected on the leaderboard/profiles. If you participated in this audit and don’t see your name on the awards list, please wait until the report is published and the findings repo is made public to check on your submissions.


[11/26/2024 13:11] tamoghna.
actually I texted in the wrong channel, I participated in loop-jul25 and my name is there in the awards list. But I participated as a team. I checked my profile nothing is there. Will it be updated when the report is published or team findings are reflected differently ?
